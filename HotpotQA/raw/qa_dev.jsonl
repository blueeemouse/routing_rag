{"question": "Lazaretto Creek divides the creek that is 18 miles east of what Georgia city?", "golden_answers": ["Savannah"], "context": "Cedar Creek is a stream in Boone and Callaway counties of the U.S. state of Missouri.  It is a tributary of the Missouri River.  The headwaters of Cedar Creek are in northeast Boone County about five miles east of Hallsville and one mile west of the Audrain-Boone county line.  The stream flows south and about five miles south of its headwaters the stream becomes the boundary between Boone and Callaway counties.  The stream crosses under Interstate 70 about eight miles east of Columbia and enters the Mark Twain National Forest.  The stream flows south to southwest through the national forest and upon leaving the forest turns to the east and ceases to be the county line.  The stream flows east for about one mile then turns south and flows under U. S. Route 63 and into the Missouri River four miles northwest of Cedar City and across the river from Jefferson City.  The Katy Trail crosses Cedar Creek just north of its confluence with the Missouri.\n\nSpirit Creek is a creek located in the Assiniboine River watershed.  It begins near Rama, Saskatchewan generally following a line to the east.  2 miles east of Rama is the Spirit Creek Reservoir, the creek continues east.  At a point 2 miles west of Buchanan the creek turns to the South and crosses Highway 5 and the CN rail line.  It continues south east from the rail line before crossing Highway 754 it then continues to Highway 47 2 miles south of Buchanan.  From there the creek passes through Patterson Lake and finds its mouth at the northernmost end of Good Spirit Lake.\n\nCockspur Island is an island in the south channel of the Savannah River near Lazaretto Creek, northwest of Tybee Island, Georgia, United States.

{"question": "The rock group Dartz! is what style of indie rock that emerged in the late 1980's in the United States?", "golden_answers": ["Math rock"], "context": "Emo is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics.  It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.  However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World.  By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.  Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.\n\nEasterhouse was a British indie rock group from the mid to late 1980s, known for jangly guitars and leftist political leaning.\n\nIndie pop (also typeset as indie-pop or indiepop) is a music genre and subculture that combines guitar pop with DIY ethic in opposition to the style and tone of mainstream pop music.  It originated from British post-punk in the late 1970s and subsequently generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit.  The style, a counterpart of indie rock, differs to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free than other indie rock.  In later years, the definition of \"indie pop\" has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings.  Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop.\n\nShoegazing (also known as shoegaze) is a subgenre of indie rock, alternative rock, and neo-psychedelia that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s.  The style is typified by the blurring of component musical parts—typically significant guitar distortion, feedback and obscured vocals—into indistinguishable mixtures of sound.\n\nDartz!  (often stylized as DARTZ!)  were a Math rock group from Middlesbrough in North East England (UK) who formed at the beginning of 2005.  They are signed to Xtra Mile Recordings in the UK and Deep Elm in the US, and released one full-length album, one mini-album, three singles and a split 7\" via Xtra Mile - as well as an EP on Sunderland based DIY micro-label Fakedream Records, and a split 10\" with Scottish band Stapleton on Gravity DIP.\n\nThe Shaky Hands were a Portland, Oregon-based rock group, formed in 2003 by musician Paul Culp, of \"Lonesome Radio Heart\" and Colin Anderson.  Nicholas Delffs joined soon after on vocals and guitar.  They spent the next three years gradually building a following in the Portland area and self-releasing two CDs, one informally called \"The Skidmore Days\", which is a lo-fi full-length album recorded in future guitarist Jeff Lehman's North Portland basement and mixed by Alex Arrowsmith.  They also released a self-titled EP informally referred to as the \"Bonnie Doon EP\", in reference to the location it was recorded.  The Shaky Hands were signed to Holocene Music in late 2006.  By this time, the lineup had changed considerably, with Mayhaw Hoons replacing Culp (who left in late 2004) on bass and the addition of second guitarist Jeff Lehman.  Nathan Delffs (Nicholas' brother, and member of The Castanets) joined shortly thereafter on percussion and lap steel.  Their sound is a fusion of 1960s style British Invasion bands such as The Kinks, The Who and The Zombies and American folk-rock in the vein of Neil Young.  The result is what many have described as a loose, jangly, rootsy style of indie rock.  The Delffs brothers (along with most of the members of Shaky Hands) also perform Shaky Hands songs (alongside original compositions) under the Death Songs moniker, a more experimental and folk-oriented side project.\n\nMath rock is a style of indie rock that emerged in the late 1980s in the United States, influenced by post-hardcore, progressive rock bands such as King Crimson and 20th century minimal music composers such as Steve Reich.  Math rock is characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting), counterpoint, odd time signatures, angular melodies, and extended, often dissonant, chords.  It bears similarities to post-rock.\n\nThis is a list of rock music genres consisting of subgenres of popular music that have roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, and which developed into a distinct identity as rock music in the 1960s, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.  By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene.  New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed.  In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques.  Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement.  From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.  Further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history.\n\nGarage punk is a rock music fusion genre combining punk rock and garage rock that took shape in the indie rock underground between the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Bands drew heavily from stripped-down 1970s punk rock and Detroit proto-punk, and incorporated numerous other styles into their approach, such as power pop, 1960s girl groups and garage rock, hardcore punk, early blues and R&B, and surf rock.\n\nIndie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s.  Originally \"Indie\" meant independent record labels and the music they produced.  \"Indie\" was often used interchangeably with \"alternative\" rock.  As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, indie identified those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective.  In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.", "id": "hotpotqa_1"}
{"question": "Å is part of the alphbet used in which group of Upper German dialects?", "golden_answers": ["Alemannic"], "context": "Hessen (German: \"Hessisch\" ) is a West Central German group of dialects of the German language in the central German state of Hessen.  The dialect most similar to Hessen is Palatinate German (Ger.: \"Pfälzisch\", pronounced ] ) of the Rhine Franconian sub-family.  However, the Hessen dialects have some features which set them somewhat apart from other West-Central German dialects.\n\nThuringian is an East Central German dialect group spoken in much of the modern German Free State of Thuringia north of the Rennsteig ridge, southwestern Saxony-Anhalt and adjacent territories of Hesse and Bavaria.  It is close to Upper Saxon spoken mainly in the state of Saxony, therefore both are also regarded as one Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect group.  Thuringian dialects are among the Central German dialects with the highest number of speakers.\n\nMain-Franconian (German: \"Mainfränkisch\" ) is group of Upper German dialects being part of the East Franconian group.  The name is derived from the river Main which meets the river Rhine near Frankfurt after having crossed the former West Germany from East to West.  The dialect is estimated by Ethnologue as 40% intelligible with Standard German.\n\nSouthern Bavarian, or Southern Austro-Bavarian, is a cluster of Upper German dialects of the Bavarian group.  They are primarily spoken in Tyrol (i.e. the Austrian federal state of Tyrol and the Italian province of South Tyrol), in Carinthia and in the western parts of Upper Styria.  Due to the geographic isolation of these Alpine regions, many features of the Old Bavarian language from the Middle High German period have been preserved.  On the other hand, the Southern Bavarian dialect area is influenced by Slovene, Italian and Ladin minority languages.\n\nSouth Bergish (German: \"Südbergische Dialekte \") or Upper Bergish (German: \"Oberbergische Dialekte \") is a group of German dialects of the Bergisches Land Region East of the Rhine and approximately south of the Wupper and north of the Sieg.  These dialects are part of the Ripuarian group and thus are also called East Ripuarian.  Ripuarian dialects are also spoken west of the Rhine up to the German border, and in some small areas next to the respective borders in Belgium and in the Netherlands.  Ripuarian Bergish dialects belong to the Middle German group, and thus are varieties of High German, where they belong to the northmost ones.  In the North, they border to the East Bergish and the West Bergish aka Low Bergish language groups, which are part of the Low Franconian group like Dutch.\n\nSouthern Germany (German: \"Süddeutschland\" ) as a region has no exact boundary, but is generally taken to include the areas where Upper German dialects are spoken.\n\nRhine Franconian (German:    ), or Rhenish Franconian, is a dialect family of West Central German.  It comprises the German dialects spoken across the western regions of the states of Saarland, Rhineland-Palatinate, northwest Baden-Wurttemberg, and Hesse in Germany.  It is also spoken in northeast France, in the eastern part of the département of Moselle in the Lorraine region, and in the north-west part of Bas-Rhin in Alsace.  To the north, it is bounded by the Sankt Goar line (“\"das/dat\" line”) which separates it from Moselle Franconian; to the south, it is bounded by the Main line which is also referred to as the \"Speyer line\" which separates it from the Upper German dialects.\n\nWest Low German, also known as Low Saxon (German: \"Niedersächsisch\" or German: \"Westniederdeutsch\" ; literally: \"Nether-saxon\"; Low German: \"Nedersassisch, Nedersaksies, Platduuts, Plat(t)\" ; Dutch: \"Nedersaksisch\" ; ) is a group of Low German (also Low Saxon; German: \"Niederdeutsch\" or \"Plattdeutsch\", Dutch: \"Nederduits\") dialects spoken in parts of the Netherlands, northwestern Germany and southern Denmark (in North Schleswig by the German minority).  It is one of two groups of mutually intelligible dialects, the other being East Low German dialects.\n\nFranconian (German: \"Fränkisch\" ; Dutch: \"Frankisch\" ) includes a number of West Germanic languages and dialects possibly derived from the languages and dialects originally spoken by the Franks from their ethnogenesis in the 3rd century AD.  The languages that evolved in the northern and eastern lands of Francia included Low Franconian, of which present-day Dutch is the primary member, the West Central German Rhine Franconian and Central Franconian dialects (including Luxembourgish), as well as transitional High Franconian German dialects.  Linguists have different views about whether these languages and dialects have descended from a single Franconian proto-language, also known as Istvaeonic.\n\nEast Central German (German: \"Ostmitteldeutsche Dialekte\" ) is the eastern, non-Franconian sub-group of Central German dialects, themselves part of High German.  Present-day Standard German as a High German variant has actually developed from a compromise of East Central (especially Upper Saxon promoted by Johann Christoph Gottsched) and East Franconian German.  East Central German dialects are mainly spoken in Central Germany and parts of Brandenburg, and were formerly also spoken in Silesia and Bohemia.", "id": "hotpotqa_2"}
{"question": "What country is the birthplace of the author of the Method of Fluxions?", "golden_answers": ["England"], "context": "Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, is the birthplace and was the family home of Sir Isaac Newton.  He was born there on 25 December 1642 (old calendar).  At that time it was a yeoman's farmstead, principally rearing sheep.\n\nA fluent is a time-varying quantity or variable.  The term was used by Isaac Newton in his early calculus to describe his form of a function.  The concept was introduced by Newton in 1665 and detailed in his mathematical treatise, \"Method of Fluxions\".  Newton described any variable that changed its value as a fluent – for example, the velocity of a ball thrown in the air.  The derivative of a fluent is known as a fluxion, the main focus of Newton's calculus.  A fluent can be found from its corresponding fluxion through integration.\n\nMethod of Fluxions is a book by Isaac Newton.  The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736.  Fluxion is Newton's term for a derivative.  He originally developed the method at Woolsthorpe Manor during the closing of Cambridge during the Great Plague of London from 1665 to 1667, but did not choose to make his findings known (similarly, his findings which eventually became the \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" were developed at this time and hidden from the world in Newton's notes for many years).  Gottfried Leibniz developed his form of calculus independently around 1673, 7 years after Newton had developed the basis for differential calculus, as seen in surviving documents like “the method of fluxions and fluents...\" from 1666.  Leibniz however published his discovery of differential calculus in 1684, nine years before Newton formally published his fluxion notation form of calculus in part during 1693.  The calculus notation in use today is mostly that of Leibniz, although Newton's dot notation for differentiation formula_1 for denoting derivatives with respect to time is still in current use throughout mechanics and circuit analysis.\n\nKay Lee Arthur (born November 11, 1933) is an international Bible teacher, four-time ECPA Christian Book Award winning author, and co-CEO of Precept Ministries International.  Kay has systematized studying the Bible, developing a set of steps to follow so as to \"mine\" the details of the given book under study.  Being systematized, it is accessible to lay persons, rather than scholars only.  Her method has been used by thousands, being taught and utilized in small to medium-sized home study groups.  This method does not teach anything as to what the book under study teaches, but guides the process of the student discovering what is within it.  This method relies heavily on inductive study, the process of building the picture from the details.  Her method of Bible study, as well as her Bible teaching, her championing of the Inductive Bible Study Method, and her national and international media broadcasts have inspired many others to study the Bible methodically.\n\nThe International Kodály Seminar was named after the famous Hungarian musician, \"Zoltán Kodály\", who was a composer, pedagogue, ethnomusicologist.  He is well-known around the world as the creator of a music method: \"Kodály method\".  Foreign musicians from all over the world come to see his birthplace, \"Kecskemét\" to get some inspiration, learn his method for a better pedagogy and listen to Hungarian choirs and concerts.  These are the main points for musicians to visit \"Kecskemét, Bács-Kiskun county\".\n\nBirthplace of Country Music Museum is a museum celebrating the historic 1927 Bristol Sessions, which recorded some of earliest country music in America when the Carter Family and Jimmie Rogers and several other musicians recorded for the first time before gaining prominence.  The museum is located at 520 Birthplace of Country Music Way in Bristol, Virginia.  A live radio station WBCM-LP broadcasts from a station within the museum.  The original site of the Bristol recordings is marked by a plaque several blocks from the museum.\n\nCharles Hayes (1678–1760) was an English mathematician and chronologist, author of an early book on the method of fluxions.  He was also a long-term official and defender of the Royal African Company, one of the earliest slave-trading companies established in Britain.\n\nThe Music of East Tennessee has a rich history, and played a major role in the development of modern country and bluegrass music.  Bristol, known as \"the birthplace of country music\", (and home of the Birthplace of Country Music Museum), and Johnson City, notable for the Johnson City recording sessions, are both towns in the Tri-Cities region of East Tennessee.  The music of East Tennessee is defined by country, gospel, and bluegrass artists, and has roots in Appalachian folk music.\n\nThe fluxion of a \"fluent\" (a time-varying quantity, or function) is its instantaneous rate of change, or gradient, at a given point.  Fluxions were introduced by Isaac Newton to describe his form of a derivative with respect to time.  Newton introduced the concept in 1665 and detailed them in his mathematical treatise, \"Method of Fluxions\".  Fluxions and fluents made up Newton's early calculus.\n\nThe Merck stitch method is a minimally invasive procedure for pinning protruding ears, developed by Merck.  The method belongs to the special types of ear pinning surgeries.  In contrast to other variations of minimally invasive procedures the stitch method does not use additional techniques from the traditional ear pinning surgeries (otoplasty).  It belongs to the closed ear pinning surgeries because the ear is not cut open for the placement of the sutures.  According to the experience of the author the Stitch Method is suitable for all protruding ears.  The stitch method is the most frequently performed otoplasty among the minimally invasive methods.", "id": "hotpotqa_3"}

{"question": "Akuna Bay is located within the estuary that is a large inlet of what larger body of water?", "golden_answers": ["Tasman Sea"], "context": "A forebay is an artificial pool of water in front of a larger body of water.  The larger body of water may be natural or man-made.\n\nClayoquot Sound is located on the west coast of Vancouver Island in the Canadian province of British Columbia.  It is bordered by the Esowista Peninsula to the south, and the Hesquiaht Peninsula to the North.  It is a body of water with many inlets and islands.  Major inlets include Sydney Inlet, Shelter Inlet, Herbert Inlet, Bedwell Inlet, Lemmens Inlet, and Tofino Inlet.  Major islands include Flores Island, Vargas Island, and Meares Island.  The name is also used for the larger region of land around the waterbody (essentially its watershed).\n\nSalt pannes and pools are water retaining depressions located within salt and brackish marshes.  Pools tend to retain water during the summer months between high tides, whereas pannes generally do not.  Salt pannes generally start when a mat of organic debris (known as \"wrack\") is deposited upon existing vegetation, killing it.  This creates a slight depression in the surrounding vegetation which retains water for varying periods of time.  Upon successive cycles of inundation and evaporation the panne develops an increased salinity greater than that of the larger body of water.  This increased salinity dictates the type of flora and fauna able to grow within the panne.  Salt pools are also secondary formations, though the exact mechanism(s) of formation are not well understood; some have predicted they will increase in size and abundance in the future due to rising sea levels.\n\nThe Akuna Bay is a bay within Broken Bay, located in the Northern Beaches Council local government area in the Northern Suburbs of Sydney, Australia.  The bay is fed by Coal and Candle Creek, with its land boundaries encased within the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.  A large marina in located within the bay.  The urban locality of Akuna Bay is located at the southern boundary of the bay.\n\nIn geography, an arm is a narrow extension, inlet, or smaller reach, of water flowing out from a much larger body of water, such as an ocean, a sea, or a lake.  Although different geographically, a sound or bay may also be called an arm.\n\nBroken Bay, a semi–mature tide-dominated drowned valley estuary, is a large inlet of the Tasman Sea located about 50 km north of Sydney central business district on the coast of New South Wales, Australia; being one of the bodies of water that separate greater Metropolitan Sydney from the Central Coast.  Broken Bay is the first major bay north of Sydney Harbour.\n\nAkuna Bay is an urban place in Sydney, Australia.  Akuna Bay is located 38 km north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council.\n\nWynniatt Bay ( ) is an Arctic waterway and large inlet on the north side of Victoria Island, Canada, between the Richard Collinson Inlet and Hadley Bay.  Most of the bay is in the Northwest Territories, but its eastern extremities (east of the 110th meridian west) are in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut.  The bay opens into Viscount Melville Sound to the north.\n\nMobile Bay is an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, lying within the state of Alabama in the United States.  Its mouth is formed by the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the eastern side and Dauphin Island, a barrier island on the western side.  The Mobile River and Tensaw River empty into the northern end of the bay, making it an estuary.  Several smaller rivers also empty into the bay: Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River on the western side of the bay, and Fish River on the eastern side.  Mobile Bay is the fourth largest estuary in the United States with a discharge of 62000 cuft of water per second.  Annually, and often several times during the summer months, the fish and crustaceans will swarm the shallow coastline and shore of the bay.  This event, appropriately named a jubilee, draws a large crowd because of the abundance of fresh, easily caught seafood it yields.  Mobile Bay is the only place on earth where jubilees are a common occurrence.\n\nA riptide is a strong, offshore current that is caused by the tide pulling water through an inlet along a barrier beach.  It is a strong tidal flow of water within estuaries and other enclosed tidal areas.  They become the strongest where the flow is constricted.  When there is a falling or ebbing tide, the water is strongly flowing through an inlet toward the ocean, especially once stabilized by jetties.  During these falling and ebbing tides, a riptide can carry a person far offshore.  For example, the ebbing tide at Shinnecock Inlet in Southampton New York, extends more than 300 m offshore.  Because of this, riptides are typically more powerful than rip currents.  During slack tide, the water is motionless for a short period of time until the flooding or rising tide starts pushing the sea water landward through the inlet.  Riptides also occur in constricted areas in bays and lagoons where there are no waves.  These strong, reversing currents can also be termed ebb jets, flood jet, or tidal jets by coastal engineers because they carry large quantities of sand that form sand bars far out in the ocean and in the bay opposite the inlet channel.  The term \"ebb jet\" would be used for a tidal current leaving an enclosed tidal area, and \"flood jet\" for the equivalent tidal current entering it.", "id": "hotpotqa_14"}

They are often used to feed fish when the aquarist is on vacation or is too busy to maintain a regular feeding schedule.\n\nJack Dempsey cichlids (\"Rocio octofasciata\") are aggressive aquarium fish named after the heavyweight boxer Jack Dempsey.  They are native to Central America but were discovered in a flooded quarry in New South Wales (NSW) Australia in 2004.  Although efforts were made to eradicate them in 2004 and 2005, the fish remain.  Jack Dempsey cichlids are one of about 30 aquarium fish species that have become established in Australian waterways, and have been shown to have a significant impact on Australian aquatic ecosystems.  They highlight the importance of preventing the importation of invasive fish species because they are extremely difficult or impossible to eradicate once they become established in the wild.\n\nAquarium fish clubs or aquarium societies are social rather than academic associations for fishkeepers.  They are to be found around the world.  Some clubs include members in all the different aspects of the hobby, while others concentrate on one particularly field, such as cichlids or marine fishkeeping.  The first aquarium society ever formed was the \"Gotha Aquarium\" in Germany, founded in 1882.  The oldest continuous aquarium club still in existence is the Boston Aquarium Society, founded in 1916.  A Brooklyn Aquarium Society in New York City founded in 1911, but disbanded mid-century, and later reformed in the 1950s with the same name.\n\nThe orange clownfish (\"Amphiprion percula\") is widely known as a popular aquarium fish.  Like other clownfishes (also known as anemonefishes), it often lives in association with sea anemones. \"A. percula\" is associated specifically with \"Heteractis magnifica\" and \"Stichodactyla gigantea\", and as larva use chemical cues released from the anemones to identify and locate the appropriate host species to use them for shelter and protection.  This causes preferential selection when finding their anemone host species.  Although popular, maintaining this species in captivity is rather complex.  The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority regulates the number of collection permits that are issued to aquarium fish dealers who seek this, and other tropical fish within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.\n\nNeolamprologus brichardi is a species of cichlid endemic to the alkaline waters of Lake Tanganyika in East Africa.  It is a popular aquarium fish kept in the fishkeeping hobby, where it is known under a variety of common names including Princess cichlid, Princess of Burundi, Lyretail cichlid, Fairy cichlid and Brichard's lamprologus.  In addition, the species is also the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour.  It is closely related to \"N. pulcher\" from the southern half of Lake Tanganyika (\"N. brichardi\" is more widespread) and some have recommended merging the two into a single species.\n\nIn fishkeeping, suitable species of aquarium fish, plants and other organisms vary with the size, water chemistry and temperature of the aquarium.\n\n\"Aquarium Fish International\" (AFI) was a North American monthly magazine, published by BowTie Inc. of Irvine, California, and dedicated to freshwater and saltwater fishkeeping and the aquarium/fishkeeping hobby in general.\n\nAquarium fish feed is plant or animal material intended for consumption by pet fish kept in aquariums or ponds.  Fish foods normally contain macro nutrients, trace elements and vitamins necessary to keep captive fish in good health.

{"question": "Turbulence or turbulent flow can be characterized by which branch of  mathematics?", "golden_answers": ["Chaos theory"], "context": "K-epsilon (k-ε) turbulence model is the most common model used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate mean flow characteristics for turbulent flow conditions.  It is a two equation model which gives a general description of turbulence by means of two transport equations (PDEs).  The original impetus for the K-epsilon model was to improve the mixing-length model, as well as to find an alternative to algebraically prescribing turbulent length scales in moderate to high complexity flows.\n\nChaos theory is a branch of mathematics focused on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.  'Chaos' is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as \"sensitive dependence on initial conditions\".  The butterfly effect describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas.\n\nvascular murmur\" ( ; from French, \"noise\"), or vascular murmur\"', is the abnormal sound generated by turbulent flow of blood in an artery due to either an area of partial obstruction; or a localized high rate of blood flow through an unobstructed artery.  The bruit may be heard (\"auscultated\") by pressing a stethoscope to the skin over the turbulent flow and listening.  Most bruits occur only in systole, so the bruit is intermittent and its frequency dependent on the heart rate.  Anything increasing the blood flow velocity such as fever, anemia, or hyperthyroidism, can increase the amplitude of the bruit.\n\nA turbulator is a device that turns a laminar flow into a turbulent flow.  Turbulent flow can be desired on parts of the surface of an aircraft wing (airfoil) or in industrial applications such as heat exchangers and the mixing of fluids.  The term “turbulator” is applied to a variety of applications and is used as a derivative of the word turbulent.  However, the word has no commonly accepted technical or scientific meaning.  As such, it has been approved as a trademark in the U.S. and other countries in conjunction with machine parts used within rotating drums, sterilizers, heat transfer ovens, mixing and pelletizing machines, and air destratification fans for horticultural and agricultural uses, among others.\n\nTurbulence or turbulent flow is a flow regime in fluid dynamics characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity.  It is in contrast to a laminar flow regime, which occurs when a fluid flows in parallel layers, with no disruption between those layers.\n\nIn fluid dynamics, turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) is the mean kinetic energy per unit mass associated with eddies in turbulent flow.  Physically, the turbulence kinetic energy is characterised by measured root-mean-square (RMS) velocity fluctuations.\n\nTransition modeling is the use of a model to predict the change from laminar and turbulence flows in fluids and their respective effects on the overall solution.  The complexity and lack of understanding of the underlining physics of the problems makes simulating the interaction between laminar and turbulent flow to be difficult and very case specific.  Transition does have the wide range of turbulence options available for most CFD applications for the following reasons.  Transition involves a wide range of scales where the energy and momentum transfer are strong influenced by inertial or non-linear effects that are unique to the simulation.  Transition also occurs using different ways, (such as natural or bypass) where modelling all options are difficult.  Most CFD code uses RANS where averaging eliminates linear disturbance.\n\nThe Reynolds number (Re ) is an important dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics used to help predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations.  It has wide applications, ranging from liquid flow in a pipe to the passage of air over an aircraft wing.  The Reynolds number is used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and used in the scaling of similar but different-sized flow situations, such as between an aircraft model in a wind tunnel and the full size version.  The predictions of onset of turbulence and the ability to calculate scaling effects can be used to help predict fluid behaviour on a larger scale, such as in local or global air or water movement and thereby the associated meteorological and climatological effects.\n\nChurn turbulent flow is a two-phase gas/liquid flow regime characterized by a highly-agitated flow where gas bubbles are sufficient in numbers to both interact with each other and, while interacting, coalesce to form larger distorted bubbles with unique shapes and behaviors in the system.  This flow regime is created when there is a large gas fraction in a system with a high gas and low liquid velocity.  It is an important flow regime to understand and model because of its predictive value in nuclear reactor vessel boiling flow.\n\nThe Taylor microscale, which is sometimes called the turbulence length scale, is a length scale used to characterize a turbulent fluid flow.  This microscale is named after Geoffrey Ingram Taylor.  The Taylor microscale is the intermediate length scale at which fluid viscosity significantly affects the dynamics of turbulent eddies in the flow.  This length scale is traditionally applied to turbulent flow which can be characterized by a Kolmogorov spectrum of velocity fluctuations.  In such a flow, length scales which are larger than the Taylor microscale are not strongly affected by viscosity.  These larger length scales in the flow are generally referred to as the inertial range.  Below the Taylor microscale the turbulent motions are subject to strong viscous forces and kinetic energy is dissipated into heat.  These shorter length scale motions are generally termed the dissipation range.", "id": "hotpotqa_24"}

{"question": "Duff Cooper denounced which settlement that allowed Germany to annex parts of Czechoslovakia?", "golden_answers": ["Munich Agreement"], "context": "Alfred Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (22 February 1890 – 1 January 1954), known as Duff Cooper, was a British Conservative Party politician, diplomat and author.  In the intense political debates of the late 1930s over appeasement, he first put his trust in the League of Nations, and realised that war with Germany was inevitable.  He denounced the Munich agreement of 1938 as meaningless, cowardly, and unworkable, as he resigned from the cabinet.  When Winston Churchill became prime minister in May 1940, he named Cooper as Minister of Information.  From 1941, he served in numerous minor diplomatic roles.  His most important role was representative to de Gaulle's Free France (1943–44) and ambassador to France from 1944–48.\n\nDiana Olivia Winifred Maud Cooper, Viscountess Norwich (née Lady Diana Manners; 29 August 1892 – 16 June 1986), was a famously glamorous social figure in London and Paris.  As a young woman, she moved in a celebrated group of intellectuals known as the Coterie, most of whom were killed in the First World War.  She married one of the few survivors, Duff Cooper, later British Ambassador to France.  After his death, she wrote three volumes of memoirs which reveal much about early 20th-century upper-class life.\n\nFollowing World War II, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg formulated plans to annex parts of Germany.  This was considered as a form of reparations in addition to monetary compensation and employment of workers.\n\nThe Saar Offensive was a French ground operation into Saarland, Germany, during the early stages of World War II, from 7 to 16 September 1939.  The plans called for roughly 40 divisions, including one armored division, three mechanised divisions, 78 artillery regiments and 40 tank battalions to assist Poland, which was then under invasion, by attacking Germany's understrength western front.  Although 30 divisions advanced to the border (and in some cases across it), the assault never happened.  When the quick victory in Poland allowed Germany to reinforce its lines with homecoming troops, the offensive was stopped.  The French forces eventually withdrew amid a German counter-offensive on 17 October.\n\nThe Duff Cooper Prize is a literary prize awarded annually for the best work of history, biography, political science or (very occasionally) poetry, published in English or French.  The prize was established in honour of Duff Cooper, a British diplomat, Cabinet member and author.  The prize was first awarded in 1956 to Alan Moorehead for his \"Gallipoli\".  At present, the winner receives a first edition copy of Duff Cooper's autobiography \"Old Men Forget\" and a cheque for £5,000.\n\nThe Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million (ISBN  ) is a non-fiction memoir by Daniel Mendelsohn, published in September 2006, which has received critical acclaim as a new perspective on Holocaust remembrance.

He is a well-known historian, travel writer and television personality.\n\nThe Munich Agreement was a settlement permitting Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation \"Sudetenland\" was coined.  The agreement was signed in the early hours of 30 September 1938 (but dated 29 September) after being negotiated at a conference held in Munich, Germany, among the major powers of Europe, excluding the Soviet Union.  Today, it is widely regarded as a failed act of appeasement toward Germany.  The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future of the Sudetenland in the face of ethnic demands made by Adolf Hitler.  The agreement was signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.  Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia, as most of its border defenses, and banks were situated there, as well as heavy industrial districts.  Part of the borderland was occupied and annexed by Poland.\n\nThe Continent of Circe (1965) is a book of essays written by Indian author Nirad C. Chaudhuri that was winner of the Duff Cooper Prize for 1966.  In this book, Chaudhuri discusses Indian society from a socio-psychological perspective, commenting on Hindu society from Prehistory to modern times.  The author's thesis is that militarism has been a way of life there from time immemorial.\n\nAfter the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II in 1945, Belgium planned to annex parts of the territory along the Belgian–German border.  In addition to monetary compensations and the lending of labour forces, this was considered a way of reparations.  In mid-April 1949, Belgium surprisingly waived any interest in most of the previously claimed areas.", "id": "hotpotqa_28"}

{"question": "What number did the song \"Reapers\"  by Muse reach on Switzerland's main music sales chart?", "golden_answers": ["number 75"], "context": "The Regional Mexican Albums is a genre-specific record chart published weekly by \"Billboard\" magazine in the United States.  The chart was established in June 1985 and originally listed the top twenty-five best-selling albums of mariachi, tejano, norteño, banda and duranguense, which are frequently considered regional Mexican.  The genre is considered by musicologist as being \"the biggest-selling Latin music genre in the United States\", and represented the fastest ever growing Latin genre in the United States after tejano music entered the mainstream market during its 1990s golden age.  Originally, \"Billboard\" based their methodology on sales surveys it sent out to record stores across the United States and by 1991 began monitoring point-of-sales compiled from Nielsen Soundscan.  Musicologist and critics have since criticized the sales data compiled from Nielsen, finding that the company only provides sales from larger music chains than from small shops that specialized in Latin music—where the majority of Latin music sales are generated.  The magazine decided to rank Latin music recordings in August 1970 under the title Hot Latin LPs, which only ranked the best-selling Latin albums in Los Angeles (Pop) and the East Coast (Salsa).  Before the chart's inception, musicians' only chart success was the Texas Latin LPs (formerly the San Antonio Latin LPs) section where regional Mexican music was more prominent.  Beginning in November 1993, \"Billboard\" lowered the rankings from twenty-five to fifteen positions on its Latin genre-specific charts, while the Top Latin Albums expanded to fifty titles.  From July 2001 until April 2005, the chart increased to twenty titles and then lowered back to fifteen titles.

{"question": "What roller coaster in Mumbai, India features five track turns that put riders upside-down? ", "golden_answers": ["Nitro"], "context": "A flying roller coaster is a type of roller coaster meant to simulate the sensations of flight by harnessing riders in a prone position during the duration of the ride.  The roller coaster cars are suspended below the track, with riders secured such that their backs are parallel to the track.  Flying roller coasters come in a variety of sizes and designs depending on the intended demographic for the ride.  Some flying roller coasters are intended for children and, thus, are relatively slow and gentle; others are meant for older children and adults and can be very fast and intense.\n\nMillennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States.  It was the fourteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak opened in 1964.  Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster, a roller coaster that exceeds 300 ft in height and completes a full circuit.  It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year.  The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island and Fury 325 at Carowinds.  It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift.  The coaster has a 310 ft , 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills.  It has a top speed of 93 mph .\n\nA wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track.  Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design.  Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns).  However, there are exceptions; the defunct Son of Beast at Kings Island had a 214 ft drop and originally had a 90 ft loop until the end of the 2006 season, although the loop had steel supports.  Other special cases are Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.  The coaster features a double-track tunnel, a corkscrew, and a 90-degree banked turn.  There is also The Voyage at Holiday World (an example of a wooden roller coaster with a steel structure for supports) featuring three separate 90-degree banked turns.  Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park has a 90-degree banked turn, T Express at Everland in South Korea with a 77-degree drop, and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City which has 3 inversions and 120-degree overbanked turn.\n\nIron Rattler is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio, Texas.  The ride opened in 2013, replacing The Rattler, a wooden roller coaster, by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler's wooden support structure.  The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees.  The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to .  It is the first hybrid wood and steel roller coaster to feature an inversion, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright.  The inversion is a zero-g-roll, which is when the train goes through a combination of a loop and a roll.\n\nA Wild Mouse roller coaster (also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse) is a type of roller coaster characterised by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track, taking tight, flat turns (without banking) at modest speeds, yet producing high lateral G-forces.  The track work is characterised by many turns and \"bunny hops\", the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces.  When approaching a turn from a straight section the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach.  Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections.  Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180°, but some coasters feature 90° turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating).  Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns.\n\nOutlaw Run is a wooden roller coaster located at the Silver Dollar City amusement park in Branson, Missouri.  The ride was the first wooden roller coaster manufactured by Rocky Mountain Construction and the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions, in which riders are turned upside-down and then back upright.  The 2937 ft ride features three inversions and a top speed of 68 mph , making \"Outlaw Run\" the sixth-fastest wooden roller coaster in the world.  The 162 ft first drop of the ride is the fourth steepest in the world among wooden roller coasters, at 81° beyond horizontal.\n\nNitro is a steel Floorless Coaster at the Adlabs Imagica amusement park located in Khopoli, Mumbai, India.  Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the roller coaster reaches a maximum height of 132 ft and a maximum speed of 65.2 mph .  The coaster also features five inversions.  Nitro opened to the public in October 2013.\n\nA roller coaster inversion is a roller coaster element in which the track turns riders upside-down and then returns them to an upright position.  Early forms of inversions, dating as far back as 1848 on the Centrifugal Railway in Paris, were vertical loops that were circular in nature.  They produced massive g-force that was often dangerous to riders, and as a result, the element eventually became non-existent with the last rides to feature the looping inversions being dismantled during the Great Depression.  In 1975, designers from Arrow Development created the corkscrew, reviving interest in the inversion during the modern age of steel roller coasters.  Since then, the element have evolved from simple corkscrews and vertical loops to more complex inversions such Immelmann loops and cobra rolls. Featuring fourteen inversions, The Smiler at Alton Towers holds the world record for the number of inversions on a roller coaster.\n\nRoller coaster phobia is a colloquial and slang term describing an individual's fear of roller coasters.  While roller coasters are the most popular theme park attraction, certain people feel nauseated, afraid, dizzy, or unsafe when riding roller coasters.  In the majority of cases, this fear is related to acrophobia, claustrophobia, or a traumatic event.  Roller coaster phobia can be overcome relatively easily, the best cure being going on the tallest/fastest roller coaster before riding roller coasters of a lesser magnitude.  Roller coaster phobia has been linked to previously experiencing an accident, vertigo, and fear of heights.  In rare cases, riders may be afraid of roller coasters due to a painful ride, tight restraints, being thrown around in the restraints, and excessive g-forces on the body of the rider.\n\nWhite Cyclone (ホワイトサイクロン , Howaito Saikuron ) is a wooden roller coaster at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan.  At 1700 m in length, White Cyclone is the third longest wooden roller coaster in the world, and is the longest wooden roller coaster outside of the United States.

{"question": "Filipino sitcom Iskul Bukol had a theme song to the tune of which hit by the King of Rock 'n' Roll?", "golden_answers": ["All Shook Up"], "context": "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer, dancer and actor.  Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\".\n\nRock 'n' Roll is the sixth studio album by John Lennon.  Released in 1975, it is an album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon.  Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East).  Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\".  As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on \"Rock 'n' Roll\".  Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions.  With \"Walls and Bridges\" coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's \"Rock 'n' Roll\" album.\n\nRock 'n' Roll Circus is the eleventh studio album by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki.

It became a fan favourite and was often played to close the band's gigs.\n\n\"Feelin' Satisfied\" is a 1978 song written by Tom Scholz for the Boston band album \"Don't Look Back\".

AXS contributor Bill Craig describes the lyrics as being about \"the wonders of rock music.\"  Pete Bishop of \"The Pittsburgh Press\" claimed that it has \"an infectious happy feel.\"  \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" critic Michael Gallucci described it as a \"simple\" song that, in common with many Boston songs, \"celebrates rock 'n' roll.\"  Gallucci rated it Boston's 8th greatest song, particularly praising the effect from the hand claps during the refrain.

{"question": "The ballistics of the .260 Remington are basically similar to a cartridge developed in what year?", "golden_answers": ["1891"], "context": "The .260 Remington (also known as 6.5-08 A-Square) cartridge was introduced by Remington in 1997.  Many wildcat cartridges based on the .308 Winchester case had existed for years before Remington standardized this round.  Although loaded to higher pressures, the ballistics of this cartridge are basically similar to the 6.5×55mm when bullet weights do not exceed 140 grains.  When loaded with heavier bullets, the 6.5×55mm is capable of greater velocity.  Due to its shorter overall length the .260 Remington can be chambered in a shorter length action than the 6.5×55mm.\n\nThe .264 Winchester Magnum is a belted, bottlenecked rifle cartridge.  Apart from the .244 H&H Magnum and .257 Weatherby Magnum, it is the smallest caliber factory cartridge derived from the 2.85 in Holland & Holland belted magnum case.  It was introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the .338 Winchester Magnum and the .458 Winchester Magnum as one of a family of short-cased 2.5 in belted magnum cartridges developed by Winchester based on the .375 Holland & Holland parent case.  It was officially introduced to the public by Winchester in 1959.  After many years of dwindling use it began enjoying a mild resurgence in popularity in the mid-2000s among long range rifle enthusiasts and reloaders due to the high ballistic coefficient of the heavier 6.5mm bullets and increasing popularity of cartridges such as 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, 6.5 Grendel, benchrest and wildcat cartridges in 6.5mm.\n\nThe .404 Jeffery is a large-caliber, rimless cartridge designed for large, dangerous game, such as the \"Big Five\" (elephant, rhino, cape buffalo, lion and leopard) of Africa.  Other names for this cartridge include .404 Jeffery Rimless, .404 Rimless Nitro Express, and 10.75× 73mm.  It was created by W.J. Jeffery & Co of England based on their desire to duplicate performance of the .450/400 (3¼\") cartridge.  There are two basically similar sets of dimensions for this case, depending on the manufacturer.  The .404 Jeffery as originally loaded fired a .423\" diameter bullet of either 300 gr with a muzzle velocity of 2600 ft/s and muzzle energy of 4500 ft.lbf or 400 gr with a muzzle velocity of 2125 ft/s and 4020 ft.lbf of energy.  It is very effective on large game and is favored by many hunters of dangerous game.  Performance and recoil are similar to other African dangerous game cartridges.  The .404 Jeffery was popular with hunters and game wardens in Africa because it gave good performance with a manageable level of recoil.  By way of comparison, the .416 Rigby and .416 Remington Magnum both fire a 400 grain .416 in bullet at 2400 ft/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 5000 ft.lbf , which handily exceeds the ballistic performance of the .404 Jeffery but at the price of greater recoil and, in the case of the .416 Rigby, rifles that are significantly more expensive.\n\nThe .17 Mach IV is a wildcat centerfire rifle cartridge, based on the .221 Remington Fireball case, necked down to fire a .172 bullet.  The cartridge was introduced in 1962 by Vern O’Brien.  The cartridge offered an easy case conversion and good ballistics, but could not compete against the .17 Remington.\n\nThe 6.5×55mm (designated as the 6.5×55 Swedish by the SAAMI and 6,5 × 55 SE by the C.I.P.) is a first-generation smokeless powder rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge.  Other, less common names are 6.5×55mm Swedish Mauser, 6.5×55mm Mauser and 6.5×55mm Krag.  It was developed in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.  The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice.  Norway adopted the Krag–Jørgensen rifle, while Sweden adopted a Mauser rifle design.\n\nA lawyer and firearm enthusiast, Charles (Chas.)  Newton's experiments with cartridge design led to the creation of the .22 Savage Hi-Power rifle cartridge which was adopted by the Savage Arms Corporation as a commercial firearm cartridge.  This success was soon followed by the design of the .250-3000 Savage.  At this period in time, Charles also experimented with wildcats based on the .30-06 Springfield case, most notably creating a forerunner of the .25-06 Remington.  This cartridge was first introduced as the .25 Newton Special.  There were probably no firearms produced in this caliber by Netwon.  It soon evolved into the .256 Newton designed to use, at first, a 123 grain bullet followed by later upgrades to 129 grain and 140 grain bullets.  Newton's premise was to use a large case for each caliber he developed in order for the larger powder charge to propel the bullet at high velocity resulting in effective terminal ballistics.  Newton developed several calibers.  The best known are the .22 Newton (90 grain bullet), .256 Newton, .30 Newton (180 grain bullet), .33 Newton (200 grain bullet), .35 Newton (250 grain bullet) and .40 Newton (300 grain bullet).  From 1914 until the late 1920s, he entered into various endeavours to promote and sell rifles in his proprietary calibers.\n\n300 AAC Blackout, SAAMI short name 300 BLK, also known as 7.62×35mm is a rifle cartridge developed in the United States by Advanced Armament Corporation (AAC) for use in the M4 carbine.  Its purpose is to achieve ballistics similar to the 7.62×39mm Soviet cartridge in an AR-15 while using standard AR-15 magazines at their normal capacity.  Care should be taken not to use 300 BLK ammunition in a rifle chambered for .223/5.56 or 7.62×40mm Wilson Tactical.\n\nThe 7mm BR Remington, commonly called the 7mm BR or the 7mm Benchrest Remington in long form, was a cartridge developed by Remington for the Remington XP-100 single-shot bolt-action handgun.  The cartridge was developed for the Unlimited Class in the sport of Metallic silhouette shooting.  Later it was introduced in the Remington Model XB-40 single-shot bolt-action rifle, which was specifically designed for the benchrest shooting community.\n\nThe .277 Wolverine (6.8×39mm) is a wildcat cartridge developed and marketed by Mark Kexel, President of Mad Dog Weapon Systems (MDWS).  It is a multi-purpose mid-power cartridge with increased ballistic performance over the AR-15's traditional .223 Remington (5.56×45mm NATO) cartridge requiring only a new barrel to upgrade/convert any 5.56-based firearm to .277 Wolverine.\n\nThe 7mm-08 Remington is a rifle cartridge that is almost a direct copy of a wildcat cartridge developed around 1958 known as the 7mm/308.  As these names would suggest, it is the .308 Winchester case necked down to accept 7 mm (.284) bullets with a small increase in case length.  Of cartridges based upon the .308, it is the second most popular behind only the .243 Winchester.  However, the .308 is more popular than both.  In 1980, the Remington Arms company popularized the cartridge by applying its own name and offering it as a chambering for their Model 788 and Model 700 rifles.", "id": "hotpotqa_40"}

Its date is not known, but various stylistic similarities with the \"Philoctetes\" (409 BCE) and the \"Oedipus at Colonus\" (401 BCE) lead scholars to suppose that it was written towards the end of Sophocles' career.\n\nAntigone ( ; Ancient Greek: Ἀντιγόνη ) is a tragedy by Sophocles written in or before 441 BC.\n\nThe William Booth Memorial Home fire occurred on 13 August 1966 at the William Booth Memorial Home for destitute and alcoholic men in Melbourne, Australia, and remains the nation's deadliest building fire.

The play shows the difficulties of communication between two people in a marriage.  This is illustrated through the two characters who appear to be talking to one another though neither seems to hear the other.  The dialogue resembles two independent monologues.  The play is often studied, read, and performed alongside \"Silence\", another one-act play published soon after \"Landscape\".  Both plays mark a change in Pinter's style, with echoes of the work of Samuel Beckett.  In both plays nothing happens, the action of the plays is brought to a halt putting an added emphasis on the role of the dialogues and monologues that take place.

The play describes the mental pain of Karna on the previous day of the Kurukshetra War.  Karnabharam is essentially the retelling of an episode of the Indian epic Mahabharata but the story is presented in a different perspective in the play.  It is perhaps the only potential tragedy in the classic Sanskrit literature, presented in a form that comes closest to the \"Vyayoga\" (Sanskrit: व्यायोग) form of one-act play.  That is so perhaps because the Natya Shastra ordains the playwrights to create plays for recreation, and essentially create happy endings .  In Karnabharam, the tragedy does not occur on-stage (Unlike Urubhanga, a tragedy that shows Duryodhana dying - again, written by Bhasa).  Karnabharam shows the valiant, generous, righteous Karna riding out towards the battle-ground, where his death under heart-wrenching circumstances is certain.  The basic plot of this play is inspired by Mahabharata.\n\nThe Brian Friel Theatre is a studio theatre located at Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland.

It is set in Baile Beag (Ballybeg), a Donegal village in 19th century agricultural Ireland.  Friel has said that \"Translations\" is \"a play about language and only about language\", but it deals with a wide range of issues, stretching from language and communication to Irish history and cultural imperialism.  Friel responds strongly to both political and language questions in the modern-day Republic of Ireland.  He said that his play \"should have been written in Irish\" but, despite this fact, he crafted carefully the verbal action in English which makes the dynamics of the play come alive, and brings its political questions into true focus.\n\nThe Field Day Theatre Company began as an artistic collaboration between playwright Brian Friel and actor Stephen Rea.

They released their debut studio album \"Sacred Heart\" in 1989, which reached #9 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the BPI.  The album's lead single, double A Side \"Break My Heart / Heroine\" did not chart, the second single however, \"You're History\", reached #7 on the UK Singles Chart, and managed similar top 20 success internationally.  Their next three singles, \"Run Silent\", \"Dirty Mind\", and \"Goodbye Cruel World\" (the lead single from their second album \"Hormonally Yours\"), all failed to peak within the UK top 50.  The second single from \"Hormonally Yours\", \"Stay\" was the group's first and only #1, staying at the top position for 8 weeks.  The song also reached #1 in Ireland and Sweden, and peaked within the top 5 in several other territories.  \"Hormonally Yours\" peaked at #3 in the UK and was certified double platinum, and reached similar success in international territories.\n\nWOW!  is the fourth album by Bananarama, released in September 1987.  The album was entirely produced and co-written with the Stock Aitken Waterman production trio and is the last album by the girl group to generate significant chart hits in the US.  Tensions between group member Siobhan Fahey and Stock, Aitken and Waterman regarding songwriting input and lyrical content (particularly with the track \"Strike it Rich\" ) prompted Fahey's departure from Bananarama months after its release.  By the time the album's fourth single, \"I Want You Back\", was released, Fahey had been replaced with Jacquie O'Sullivan, who re-recorded the vocals for the single version of the song.  Fahey would resurface in 1988 with her new band, Shakespears Sister.\n\nShakespears Sister is a pop-rock project, formed by Irish-born singer–songwriter Siobhan Fahey in 1988, and based in the United Kingdom.

Together they released two Top 10 albums and a string of Top 40 hits, including the 1992 hit \"Stay\" which peaked at No. 1 in the UK for eight consecutive weeks.

The album was recorded after Siobhan Fahey decided to leave girl group Bananarama.  Initially intended as a solo act for Fahey, Shakespear's Sister became a partnership of Fahey and Marcella Detroit during the making of the album.  The album spawned four singles, including \"You're History\", released in July 1989, which reached No. 7 on the UK singles chart and was the first release to present the project as a duo.  The album peaked at No. 9 on the UK albums chart, and was certificated gold by the BPI.\n\n\"Bad Blood\" is a single originally released by Siobhan Fahey under her own name.

The other was the Soviet Air Defence Forces.  The Air Forces were formed from components of the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1917, and faced their greatest test during World War II.  The groups were also involved in the Korean War, and dissolved along with the Soviet Union itself in 1991–92.  Former Soviet Air Forces' assets were subsequently divided into several air forces of former Soviet republics, including the new Russian Air Force.  \"March of the Pilots\" was its anthem.\n\nAn Aviation Division (Russian: авиационная дивизия ) was a type of formation of the Military Air Forces of the Red Army during the Second World War, the Soviet Air Forces, Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) and Aviation of the Military Naval Fleet, and since 1991 remain major formations within the Military Air Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe 23rd Air Army was an Air army of the Soviet Air Forces and the Russian Air Forces, active from the 1960s to the 1990s.

Its first flight was in early 1944 and it entered service with the Soviet Air Forces later in the year.  A small batch of La-7s was given to the Czechoslovak Air Force the following year, but it was otherwise not exported.  Armed with two or three 20 mm cannon, it had a top speed of 661 km/h .  The La-7 was felt by its pilots to be at least the equal of any German piston-engined fighter.  It was phased out in 1947 by the Soviet Air Force, but served until 1950 with the Czechoslovak Air Force.\n\nThe 5th Air Army was an air army of the Soviet Air Forces and later the Ukrainian Air Force.  First formed in 1942 during World War II, the army provided air support to Soviet forces through the rest of the war, and was renumbered as the 48th Air Army in 1949.

On 21 March 1946, CAF headquarters personnel and facilities at Bolling Field, along with 1 of the 4 CAF Air Forces (2nd—which had its HQ inactivated on 30 March ) became Strategic Air Command.  US Strategic Air Forces of WWII, e.g., Eighth Air Force and Fifteenth Air Force, transferred later to SAC.  Most of the CAF airfields that had not been distributed to other commands when SAC activated were subsequently transferred to Air Defense Command (to which CAF's 1st & 4th Air Forces were assigned on 21 March), Tactical Air Command (3rd Air Force), and Air Materiel Command from 23 March 1946 to 16 March 1947 before the USAF was activated in September 1947.\n\nAn Aviation Regiment (Russian: авиационный полк ) {\"aviaciónnyj polk\") was a type of unit employed to organise aircraft and their crews in air combat in the Military Air Forces of the Red Army during the Second World War, the Soviet Air Forces, Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) and Soviet Naval Aviation, and since 1991 remain major formations within the Russian Air Force and the Russian Naval Aviation.\n\n\"Night Witches\" (German: \"Nachthexen\" ; Russian: Ночные ведьмы , \"Nochnye Vedmy\") was a World War II German nickname for the women military aviators of the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, known later as the 46th \"Taman\" Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, of the Soviet Air Forces.

Thigh highs are held up by one or more bands sewn to the top that is backed with silicone on its inner surface.  This ensures the thigh highs stay in position because of the elastic and the friction of the silicone against the skin.  The silicone can become ineffective by contact with body lotions, oils and talcum powder, as they all reduce the friction of the silicone.  Thigh highs are designed so that the elastic band exerts just the right pressure on a woman's thigh, avoiding any uncomfortable tightness or unflattering muffin-top effect.  Sometimes thigh highs are preferred to pantyhose for hygiene reasons, because they reduce excessive microbial growth around the groin due to humidity and warmth.", "id": "hotpotqa_67"}

It is located in western India on the banks of the River Sabarmati.  The city served as political as well as economical capital of the region since its establishment.  The earliest settlement can be recorded around the 12th century under Chaulukya dynasty rule.  The present city was founded on 26 February 1411 and announced as the capital on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate as a new capital.  Under the rule of sultanate (1411–1511) the city prospered followed by decline (1511–1572) when the capital was transferred to Champaner.  For next 135 years (1572-1707), the city renewed greatness under the early rulers of Mughal Empire.  The city suffered due to political instability (1707-1817) under late Mughal rulers followed by joint rule between Maratha and Mughal.  The city further suffered following joint Maratha rule.  The city again progressed when politically stabilized when British East India Company established the rule in the city (1818-1857).  The city further renewed growth when it gain political freedom by establishment of municipality and opening of railway under British crown rule (1857–1947).  Following arrival of Mahatma Gandhi in 1915, the city became centre stage of Indian independence movement.  Many activists like Sardar Patel served the municipality of the city before taking part in the movement.  After independence, the city was a part of Bombay state.  When Gujarat was carved out in 1960, it again became the capital of the state until establishment of Gandhinagar in 1965.  Ahmedabad is also the cultural and economical centre of Gujarat and the seventh largest city of India.\n\nThe Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.  The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles northeast of Delhi (now Old Delhi).  It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.  The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.  On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities formally to have ended until 8 July 1859.  The rebellion is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and India's First War of Independence.\n\nThe jute trade is centred mainly around Bangladesh and the Indian State of West Bengal.  The major producing country of jute is Bangladesh, due to its natural fertile soil.  Bengal Jute was taken to Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later by the East India Company to Britain.  By the 1790s a much larger trade had developed in the Scottish city of Dundee, the European home of jute spinners.  Introduced to the British by the East India Company, crude fibre was the bulk still exported from Bengal after 1790, but a thriving trade did not really begin until after 1850 through mechanised processing, to meet rising demand.  Raw jute was imported from Bengal by the British East India Company.  British Jute Barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute.  Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade.  Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories.  More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United States southern region to bag cotton and coffee.  It was used in the fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry.  India, China, Thailand, Myanmar also produce Jute in low quantities.  India is one of the largest importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and exporter of raw jute.  Therefore, the local price of raw jute in Bangladesh is the international price.  Ironically, the local price of jute goods produced in India set their own price.\n\nMir Qasim (also spelt Mir Kasim; full name: Mir Kasim Ali Khan) (died May 8, 1777) was the Nawab of Bengal from 1760 to 1763.  He was installed as Nawab with the support of the British East India Company, replacing Mir Jafar, his father-in-law, who had himself been supported earlier by the East India Company after his role in the Battle of Plassey.  However, Mir Jafar was in conflict with the East India company over too many demands and tried to tie up with the Dutch East India Company.  The British eventually overran the Dutch forces at Chinsura and played a major role in replacing Mir Jafar with Mir Qasim.  Qasim later fell out with the British and fought them at the Battle of Buxar.  His defeat has been suggested as the last real chance of preventing a gradual British expansion in large parts of North East India following Britain's victory in the Seven Years War.\n\nMajor-General Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (29 September 1725 – 22 November 1774), also known as Clive of India, Commander-in-Chief of British India, was a British officer and privateer who established the military and political supremacy of the East India Company in Bengal.  He is credited with securing a large swath of South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan) and the wealth that followed, for the British East India Company.  In the process, he also turned himself into a multi-millionaire.  Together with Warren Hastings he was one of the key early figures setting in motion what would later become British India.  Blocking impending French mastery of India, and eventual British expulsion from the continent, Clive improvised a military expedition that ultimately enabled the East India Company to adopt the French strategy of indirect rule via puppet government.  Hired by the company to return a second time to India, Clive conspired to secure the Company's trade interests by overthrowing the locally unpopular heir to the throne of \"Bengal,\" the richest state in India, richer than Britain, at the time.  Back in England, he sat as a Tory Member of Parliament in London.\n\nLieutenant-General Sir William Russell, 2nd Baronet (5 April 1822 – 19 March 1892), was a British Army officer who served in the Crimean War and in the suppression of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, and then became a Liberal Party politician.  He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover from 1857 to 1859, and for Norwich from 1860 to 1874.\n\nLieutenant-General Sir Mark Cubbon KCB (23 August 1775 – 23 April 1861) was a British army officer with the East India Company who became the British Commissioner of Mysore state in 1834.  During his tenure, he established a law and order system, introduced judicial and economic reforms and through action in all spheres of governance helped develop the economy of Mysore.  He resigned from his office in 1860 due to ill-health and left for England for the first time since his arrival in India as a cadet in 1800.  The administration of the Kingdom of Mysore under his leadership ensured that the 1857 rebellion had almost no repercussions in the region.  He died in 1861 on board ship at Suez.  Cubbon Road and Cubbon Park in Bangalore are named after him.\n\nMir Jafar Ali Khan Bahadur (c. 1691–5 February 1765) was the first Nawab of Bengal with support from the British East India Company.  He was the second son of Sayyid Ahmad Najafi.  His rule is widely considered the start of British imperialism in India and was a key step in the eventual British domination of vast areas of the subcontinent.  Siraj ud-Daulah, the previous Nawab of Bengal along with his army were defeated and killed in the Battle of Plassey by the British due to the betrayal of the commander of Siraj ud-Daulah′s army, Mir Jafar, who betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah to become the next Nawab.  Thus after helping the British defeat Siraj ud-Daulah he became the new Nawab of Bengal in 1757 with military support from the British East India Company as a reward for his betrayal.  However, Jafar failed to satisfy constant British demands for money.  In 1758, Robert Clive discovered that through his agent Khoja Wajid, Jafar had made a treaty with the Dutch at Chinsurah.  Dutch ships of war were also seen in the River Hooghly.  Circumstances led to the Battle of Chinsurah.  British company official Henry Vansittart proposed that since Jafar was unable to cope with the difficulties, Mir Qasim, Jafar's son-in-law, should act as Deputy Subahdar.  In October 1760, the company forced him to abdicate in favor of Qasim.  However, Qasim's independent spirit and plan to force the East India company out of his dominion led to his overthrow, and Jafar was restored as the Nawab in 1763 with the support of the company.  Mir Qasim however refused to accept this and went to war against the company.  Jafar ruled until his death on 17 January 1765 and lies buried at the Jafarganj Cemetery in Murshidabad, West Bengal, India.\n\nRamsay Weston Phipps (10 April 1838 – 24 June 1923) was an Irish-born military historian and officer in Queen Victoria's Royal Artillery.  The son of Pownoll Phipps, an officer of the British East India Company's army, he was descended from the early settlers of the West Indies; many generations had served in the British, and the English military.  Phipps served in the Crimean War, had a stint of duty at Malta, and helped to repress the Fenian uprising in Canada in 1866.\n\nThe Carnatic Wars (also spelled Karnatic Wars) were a series of military conflicts in the middle of the 18th century in India.  The conflicts involved numerous nominally independent rulers and their vassals, struggles for succession and territory, and included a diplomatic and military struggle between the French East India Company and the British East India Company.  They were mainly fought on the territories in India which were dominated by the Nizam of Hyderabad up to the Godavari delta.  As a result of these military contests, the British East India Company established its dominance among the European trading companies within India.  The French company was pushed to a corner and was confined primarily to Pondichéry.  The East India company's dominance eventually led to control by the British Company over most of India and eventually to the establishment of the British Raj.", "id": "hotpotqa_77"}

The commander-in-chief of all Filipino and American forces in the islands, General Douglas MacArthur, consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the Bataan Peninsula to fight against the Japanese invaders.  By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia.  The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.  Despite a lack of supplies, Filipino and American forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward.  As the combined Filipino and American forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific.  The surrender at Bataan, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether, was the largest in American and Filipino military histories, and was the largest United States surrender since the American Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.  Soon afterwards, Filipino and American prisoners of war were forced into the Bataan Death March.\n\nJames Winchester (February 26, 1752 – July 26, 1826) was an officer in the American Revolutionary War and a brigadier general during the War of 1812.

It could accommodate 32 passengers, or 16 in sleeper cabins, and was the last flying boat built by the company.  Despite acceptable handling and performance within design specifications, no commercial orders were forthcoming and faced with no domestic market for aircraft already built, the company obtained export permits for them.  The first two production aircraft were sold to Japan, ostensibly for commercial airline use, however one of them was dismantled, reverse-engineered and formed the basis for the development of the Kawanishi H8K.  The second one was lost on a survey flight in 1938.  The second production pair were sold (as DF-195's) to the Soviet Union and after winterizing, were disassembled and transported to Russia via ship, where they were operated as transports by Aeroflot.\n\nPlaya Vista is a neighborhood located in the Westside of the City of Los Angeles, California, United States, north of LAX.  Prior to the development of Playa Vista, the area was the headquarters of Hughes Aircraft Company from 1941 to 1985, and was the site of the construction of the Hughes H-4 Hercules \"Spruce Goose\" aircraft.

Locally known as \"padagu\" or \"salangu\" among the fisher folks, it is a large, flat-bottomed, high-sided, open boat with a clumsy design consisting of mango wood planks sewed together with strands of coir which cross over a wadding of the same material, but without frames or ribs, so that the shock due to surf is much reduced.  It is specially designed for use where there are no harbours of refuge, chiefly upon the surf-beaten Coromandel Coast of India.  It is used in shooting shore seines and also as a cargo lighter.  Its range extends along the whole of the eastern coast of India northwards of Cape Calimere.  The equivalent type of boats used on the west coast are the beach lighters.

Intended as a transatlantic flight transport for use during World War II, it was not completed in time to be used in the war.  The aircraft made only one brief flight on November 2, 1947, and the project never advanced beyond the single example produced.  Built from wood because of wartime restrictions on the use of aluminum and concerns about weight, it was nicknamed by critics the \"Spruce Goose\", although it was made almost entirely of birch.  The Hercules is the largest flying boat ever built, and it has the largest wingspan of any aircraft that has ever flown.

The squadron was originally formed in 1915 as an aerial reconnaissance unit of the Royal Flying Corps serving on the Western Front during First World War.  Becoming part of the Royal Air Force on its formation in 1918, it was disbanded the following year as part of the post-First World War scaling back of the RAF.  During the Second World War the squadron operated in the torpedo bomber role over the North Sea and then in the Mediterranean and the Far East.  Between 1955 and 2015 the squadron provided military search and rescue over the United Kingdom.\n\nWestern Air Command was the part of the Royal Canadian Air Force's Home War Establishment responsible for air operations on the Pacific coast of Canada during the Second World War.  When Canada declared war against Germany in September 1939 the command consisted of only five squadrons.  Four of them equipped with obsolete aircraft including a bomber squadron with aircraft from the Great War and there were no fighter aircraft at all for its only fighter squadron (113 Fighter Squadron was thus disbanded).  With the Japanese threat after Pearl Harbor it grew rapidly and played a critical role in fighter and anti-submarine operations in Canadian and American waters during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.  It was there that Squadron Leader K.A. Boomer of No. 111 Squadron shot down a Rufe fighter, the RCAF's only kill in the Pacific Theatre.  On 7 July 1942 a Bristol Bolingbroke pressed home an attack on the Japanese Submarine Ro 32 the pilot F/Sgt.  P.M.G. Thomas of No. 115 Squadron RCAF then led American Destroyers to sink the damaged submarine.  By January 1943 Western Air Command had expanded to include many bomber, fighter and operational units under its control.  By the end of the war the command would involve some twenty squadrons when the last units to join were added in 1943.  These were the 163 Army Cooperation Squadron in March flying Bristol Bolingbrokes and Hawker Hurricanes, in May the 160 Bomber-Reconnaissance Squadron was added flying Cansos from Sea Island BC (before moving to Yarmouth NS in July) and the 166 Communication Squadron formed in September flying various types.  In addition to the new squadrons, new aircraft types came on line replacing the command's remaining Supermarine Stranraers and Blackburn Sharks with Canso's and the Bolingbrokes and Beauforts with the Lockheed Ventura.  Countless training missions and operational patrols bolstered the air activity over the coastal areas but there was not much action until RCAF Western Command was on the look out for General Kusaba's Fire Balloons that the Japanese called the Fūsen Bakudan Campaign.  In February and March 1945, P-40 fighter pilots from 133 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force operating out of RCAF Patricia Bay (Victoria, British Columbia), intercepted and destroyed two fire balloons, On 21 February, Pilot Officer E. E. Maxwell While shot down a balloon, which landed on Sumas Mountain, in Washington State.  On 10 March, Pilot Officer J. O. Patten destroyed a balloon near Saltspring Island, British Columbia.  During another interception a Canso forced down a fire balloon which was examined at the army headquarters.  Patrol activity was joined by the Operational Training Schools (OTS) operated by Number 4 Training Command of the BCATP.  They were the No. 3 OTS flying the Canso and Catalina and No. 32 OTS with Ansons, Beauforts and Swordfish at Patricia Bay.  In April, 1944 the No. 5 OTS Heavy Conversion unit stood up at Boundary Bay when 16 B-24 Liberators arrived fresh from American factories.  By the end of September 1944 RCAF 5 O.T.U. had grown to sizeable force of some 87 aircraft including 38 B-24 Liberators, 35 B-25 Mitchells, 5 Bolingbrokes, 8 P-40 Kittyhawks and a single Norseman.  With the end of the war in Europe these aircraft were joined by a number of Victory Aircraft Lancaster X bombers which were to be used to train the British Commonwealth's Very Long Range Bomber Tiger Force that would soon be sent to bomb the Japanese mainland from Okinawa.  With the unconditional surrender of Japan the RCAF's Tiger Force bomber squadrons were disbanded before they flew overseas and the total draw down of the Western Air Command was suddenly undertaken.  Within several months almost all the flying squadrons would be completely stood down.\n\nNo. 76 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force.  It was formed during World War I as a home defence fighter squadron and in its second incarnation during World War II flew as a bomber squadron, first as an operational training unit and later as an active bomber squadron.  With the end of the war the squadron converted to the role of transport squadron, to be reactivated shortly in the bomber role during the 1950s.  From 2007 to 2011, it was a training unit, equipped with the Short Tucano at RAF Linton-on-Ouse.\n\nMarshal of the Royal Air Force Charles Frederick Algernon Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, (21 May 1893 – 22 April 1971) was a senior Royal Air Force officer.  He served as a bomber pilot in the First World War, and rose to become first a flight commander and then a squadron commander, flying light bombers on the Western Front.  In the early stages of the Second World War he was commander-in-chief of Bomber Command.  He was an advocate of strategic area bombing against German industrial areas, and viewed it as a war winning strategy.  In October 1940 he was made Chief of the Air Staff, and remained in this post for the rest of the war.  During his time as Chief he continuously supported the strategic bombing offensive against Germany, and advocated the formation of the Pathfinder Force, critical to improving the destructive force of Bomber Command.  He fended off attempts by the Royal Navy to take command over RAF Coastal Command, and resisted attempts by the British Army to establish their own Army Air Arm.  Portal retired from the RAF following the end of the war.  He served as Controller of Production (Atomic Energy) at the Ministry of Supply for six years.  Portal was then made chairman of British Aluminium.  He was unsuccessful in fending off a hostile takeover of British Aluminum by Sir Ivan Stedeford's Tube Investments, in what was known as the \"Aluminium War\".  Afterward he served as chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation.", "id": "hotpotqa_93"}

She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of classical Hollywood cinema in the 1950s.  She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well known public figure for the rest of her life.  In 1999, the American Film Institute named her the seventh-greatest female screen legend.\n\nA feature film is a film (also called a movie, motion picture or just film) with a running time long enough to be considered the principal or sole film to fill a program.  The notion of how long this should be has varied according to time and place.  According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute, and the British Film Institute, a feature film runs for 40 minutes or longer, while the Screen Actors Guild states that it is 80 minutes or longer.\n\nAudrey Hepburn (4 May 1929 – 20 January 1993) was a British actress who had an extensive career in film, television, and on the stage from 1948 to 1993.

Born on May 16, 1883 in Hertfordshire in England, she would make her screen debut in the 1924 film \"Secrets\", starring Betty Compson and Noah Beery.

Art of the AIDS crisis typically sought to: make a sociopolitical statement, stress the medical impact of the disease, or express feelings of longing and loss.  These ideologies were present in conceptions of art in the 1980s, but are pertinent to reception of art today as well.  More specifically, Elizabeth Taylor spoke at a benefit for AIDS involving artwork, emphasizing its importance to activism in that, \"art lives on forever.\"  This comment articulates the ability of artwork from this time to teach and impact contemporary audiences, post-crisis.

The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom.  It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings.  He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by.  Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him.  Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.

But Johnson declined.  When Ulysses S. Grant became President he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior and Cox immediately accepted.  Secretary of Interior Cox implemented the first civil service reform in a federal government department, including examinations for most clerks.  Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform, creating America's first Civil Service Commission.  However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers, who ultimately convinced Grant to cease civil service reforms.  President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty.  Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre.  Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant's support over civil service reform.  Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as President.  In 1872 Cox joined the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant's renomination.  In 1876 Cox returned to politics and was elected to and served one term as United States Congressman of Ohio.  Congressman Cox supported President Hayes's reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform.  Cox retired and did not return to active politics, using his time to write several books on Civil War campaigns which remain today respected histories and memoirs.\n\nSt Edwen's Church, Llanedwen is a 19th-century parish church near the Menai Strait, in Anglesey, north Wales.

Charles first became involved with dogs when he began to work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits.  He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle.  After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895.  He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois.  He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.\n\nThe Halls Heeler was a dog bred by Thomas Simpson Hall to herd cattle on the Hall family's extensive properties in north-western New South Wales in the 19th century.  On \"Dartbrook Station\", in the Upper Hunter Valley, Hall selectively crossed the offspring of Northumberland Drover's Dogs (Border Collie lineage) that he had imported, with progeny of dingoes that he had tamed.  By 1840 he had bred the type of dog that he needed to control cattle on the massive runs that his family owned, and until he died in 1870 few of these dogs were owned and used by anyone outside the Hall family and their workers.  However the death of Thomas Hall and the break-up of the Hall estate coincided with the development of the dog show, and an interest in breeding dogs to specific criteria or standards.  The Halls Heeler was further developed into two contemporary dog breeds the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.  The name is spelled both with the possessive apostrophe, as Hall's Heeler, and without.\n\nThe title Best in Show is awarded annually to the dog chosen as winner of the Crufts dog show, according to conformation show rules.  This title was first awarded in 1928, the initial winner being Primley Sceptre, a fawn Greyhound.  Previously, Crufts had used the title \"Best Champion\", sponsored by the \"Illustrated Kennel News\", which was awarded from 1905 to 1914.  The first winner of Best Champion was Ch.  The Sable Mite, a Pomeranian.  According to \"Crufts: The Official History\" the first winner of that award was the first dog to be considered the \"best\" at a Crufts show, although it only lists winners between 1906 and 1912.\n\nSnuppy (Korean: 스너피 a portmanteau of \"SNU\" and \"puppy\"; born April 24, 2005) is an Afghan hound, credited with being the world's first cloned dog.

Department of theriogenology and biotechnology at Seoul National University for cloning Snuppy was led by Woo Suk Hwang.  Snuppy has since been used in the first known successful breeding between cloned canines, after his sperm was used to artificially inseminate two cloned females, which resulted in the birth of 10 puppies in 2008.\n\nNORD Ch.

Descended from the draught oxen long used on the Weald they were selectively bred from the late 18th century to form a modern beef breed which is now used in many countries around the world.  They have a thin summer coat and many sweat glands, but grow a thick coat in winter, so they are suited to both hot summers and cold winters.  They have a placid temperament but can be very stubborn.\n\nBakhmull is an Aboriginal Afghan Hound belonging to an ancient group of oriental sighthounds.  The Afghan Royal Family were the only humans who possessed this breed.  The bakhmull tazi (tazi means \" fast running sighthound\" ) is a long haired variety of sighthounds in Afghanistan.  There are two more: Luchak tazi short haired like sloughi and Khalagh tazi with moderate long hair on ears, shoulders, elbows and thighs.Bakhmull tazi has developed in the mountain areas of Mid and Central Asia - ancient Punjab, Paunchala, \"Five river land\".  This dog breed roots back presumably in the ancient Indian Harappa( Mohenjo Daro) civilization 2300 - 1700 B.C.  If translated from Pashto (Afghan) the word \"bakhmull\" means \"velvet\" due to its incredible silky velvet, long, ivory color hair of the coat, rather abundant and long on the whole body, because it is a mountain oriental sighthound, except the \"saddle\", front parts of four legs and the muzzle.  Its color is always fawn, ivory or white with a darker \"saddle\", thus it produces an impression of a fawn (yellowish) dog which coat color is protective khaki that matches sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts.  Following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black and black with white spots.  Bakhmulls hunt the wild ram, ibex (wild mountain goat), hare, fox, wolf, jackal, wild big cats, in old times leopard, but never birds.  They are also good guards; they guard homes and flocks of sheep.  They hunt solo, in couples and rarely in packs.  Since the 1980s the centre of Bakhmull breeding is in Russia, \"The Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull\" Moscow, where they are spread all over the former Soviet Republics and various regions.  The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 70s by military men from Afghanistan.  Breed Standard for tazi BAKHMULL (aboriginal Afghan Hound) was adopted in Moscow, Russia (since Russia has become the 2nd motherland of bakhmulls) first in 1985 and later after detailed elaboration in 1997 (RFOS-RKF).\n\nChris Amoo is a singer-songwriter and the lead singer of English soul group, The Real Thing.

{"question": "Are the bands Flow and Against the Current from the same country?", "golden_answers": ["no"], "context": "Liquified flows and fluidized flows are types of sediment-gravity flows in which grains within the flow are kept suspension by the upward movement of fluid.  They form in granular substances where the concentration of suspended mud is too low to develop cohesive forces within the flow.  As grains at the base of the suspension settle out, fluid that is displaced upward by the settling generates pore fluid pressures that can help suspend grains in the upper part of the flow.  Application of an external pressure to the suspension will initiate flow.  This external pressure can be applied by a seismic shock, which may turn transform loose sand into a highly viscous suspension as in quicksand.  Generally as soon as the flow begins to move, fluid turbulence results and the flow rapidly evolves into a turbidity current.  Flows and suspensions are said to be liquefied when the grains settle downward through the fluid and displace the fluid upwards.  By contrast, flows and suspensions are said to fluidized when the fluid moves upward through the grains, thereby temporarily suspending them.  Most flows are liquefied, and many references to fluidized sediment gravity flows are in fact incorrect and actually refer to liquified flows.  Because fluid is displaced upward in these types of flows, dewatering features such as dish structures, pillars, pipes and dikes are common.\n\nA geostrophic current is an oceanic flow in which the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis effect.  The direction of geostrophic flow is parallel to the isobars, with the high pressure to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere, and the high pressure to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.  This concept is familiar from weather maps, whose isobars show the direction of geostrophic flow in the atmosphere.  Geostrophic flow may be either barotropic or baroclinic.  A geostrophic current may also be thought of as a rotating shallow water wave with a frequency of zero.  The principle of geostrophy is useful to oceanographers because it allows them to infer ocean currents from measurements of the sea surface height (by combined satellite altimetry and gravimetry) or from vertical profiles of seawater density taken by ships or autonomous buoys.  The major currents of the world's oceans, such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, the Agulhas Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, are all approximately in geostrophic balance and are examples of geostrophic currents.\n\nAn antidune is a bedform found in fluvial and other channeled environments.  Antidunes occur in supercritical flow, meaning that the Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this is also known as upper flow regime.  In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms.  As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow.  Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; this is due to the supercritical flow regime.  Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream.  The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude.  When that wave becomes unstable, breaks and washes downstream, much of the antidune bedform may be destroyed.\n\nThe East Australian Current (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the South Equatorial Current (SEC) crossing the Coral Sea and reaching the eastern coast of Australia.  At around 15° S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC.  It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia.  The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30° S where its flow can reach 90 cm/s.  As it flows southward it splits from the coast at around 31° to 32° S. By the time it reaches 33° S it begins to undergo a southward meander while another portion of the transport turns back northward in a tight recirculation.  At this location the EAC reaches its maximum transport of nearly 35 Sv.  The majority of the EAC flow that does not recirculate will move eastward into the Tasman Front crossing the Tasman Sea just north of the cape of New Zealand.  The remaining will flow south on the EAC Extension until it reaches the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  The Tasman Front transport is estimated at 13 Sv.  The eastward movement of the EAC through the Tasman Front and reattaching to the coastline of New Zealand forms the East Auckland Current.  The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast.\n\nFlow is a Japanese rock band, formed in 1998 and signed on to Sony Music Japan's Ki/oon Music label.

The group gained a sizable YouTube following after posting their covers of popular songs from a variety of different artists.\n\nA turbidity current is most typically an underwater current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope.  Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water.  In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters.  The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid.  These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water.  As such currents flow, they often have a \"snow-balling-effect\", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current.  Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded.  Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column.  The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.\n\nA reservoir capacitor is a capacitor that is used to smooth the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier.  The reservoir capacitor releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its phase resulting in change in 'direction of flow of current'.  The change in 'direction of flow of current' of the AC source takes a very small amount of time.  In this short gap of time, the continuous flow of current gradually moves to the state when it ceases.  Using a reservoir capacitor, we fill this gap; since the capacitor releases its stored energy (gets discharged) in that gap of time.  This allows the load to be powered at all times without any interruption.\n\nElectrical polarity (positive and negative) is the direction of current flow in an electrical circuit.  Current flows from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole.  Electrons flow from negative to positive.  In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive.  In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and the direction of the current (electron flow) reverses periodically.\n\nDirect current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge.  A battery is a good example of a DC power supply.  Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams.  The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC).  A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.", "id": "hotpotqa_113"}

{"question": "Aśvaghoṣa is considered one of the greatest Indian poets before the time of which Sanskrit writer and dramatist?", "golden_answers": ["Kālidāsa"], "context": "Kālidāsa was a Classical Sanskrit writer, widely regarded as the greatest poet and dramatist in the Sanskrit language.  His plays and poetry are primarily based on the Indian Puranas.\n\nIndian poetry and Indian literature in general, has a long history dating back to Vedic times.  They were written in various Indian languages such as Vedic Sanskrit, Classical Sanskrit, Hindi, Oriya, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali and Urdu.  Poetry in foreign languages such as Persian and English also has a strong influence on Indian poetry.  The poetry reflects diverse spiritual traditions within India.  In particular, many Indian poets have been inspired by mystical experiences.Poetry is the oldest form of literature and has a rich written and oral tradition.\n\nSubrahmanya Saastri, Mellacheruvu(born 22 May 1948) is a prolific scholar, poet, writer, dramatist and translator in Sanskrit and Telugu.  Born in Tenali of Guntur district of undivided Andhra Pradesh studied at famous Oriental College Kota Lakshmaiah Naidu Sanskrit College, Tenali.  He received his first Oriental title \"Saahitya Vidyaa Praveena\" from this college.  Later he earned his first class Master's both in Sanskrit and in Telugu from Andhra University, Vizag, Andhra Pradesh.  Spent nearly four decades in teaching and writing in Sanskrit and Telugu, he retired as Senior lecturer from Gorantla Venkkanna Sanskrit Oriental College, Timmasamudram, Andhra Pradesh.  Well known for his multiple works in Sanskrit and Telugu; some of his most popular works are: \"Sri Gurucharita Mahaakaavyam\",\"Lalitaananda Lahari\", \"Saalabhanjika Sutradhaaram\", \"Akarmaanada Lahari\",\"Sri Krishna Raasa Leela--Yogatrayee Hela\", \"Gajendra Moksham-Rishi Runam\", \"Vaamanudu-Vamanamu\" and \"Saami Saranam\".  These works deconstruct the hitherto unknown semiotics, which relate to Yoga and to different paths of Self-realization embedded in ancient Indian spiritual literature.  These work also lay bare the phenomenology, rhetoric and psychoanalysis associated with the narrative and logic (\"tarka\") in the ancient Sanskrit texts.\n\nAśvaghoṣa or Ashvaghosha (/'əɕʋə'gʰoːʂə/ ;  80 – c. 150 CE ) was an Indian philosopher-poet, born in Saketa in northern India to a Brahmin family.  He is believed to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist, and is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to Kālidāsa.  He was the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers, whose epics rivalled the contemporary Ramayana.  Whereas much of Buddhist literature prior to the time of Aśvaghoṣa had been composed in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, Aśvaghoṣa wrote in Classical Sanskrit.\n\nItihasa consists of the \"Mahabharata\" and the \"Ramayana\" (sometimes the Puranas too, are included).  The \"Mahabharata\" includes the story of the Kurukshetra War and also preserves the traditions of the Lunar dynasty in the form of embedded tales.  The \"Puranas\" narrate the universal history as perceived by the Hindus – cosmogony, myth, legend and history.  The \"Ramayana\" contains the story of Rama and incidentally relates the legends of the Solar dynasty.  The classical Indian poets usually derive the story of their poetry and drama from the Itihasas.  In our time, these traditions have been most carefully reconstructed from the available texts and arranged in chronological order by F. E. Pargiter in his compendium \"Ancient Indian Historical Tradition\".\n\nManohar Shetty (born 1953) is a Goa-based poet, who has eight books of poems to his credit and is considered one of the prominent Indian poets writing in the English language.\n\nDilip Purushottam Chitre (17 September 1938 – 10 December 2009) was one of the foremost Indian poets and critics to emerge in the post Independence India.  Apart from being a very important bilingual writer, writing in Marathi and English, he was also a painter and filmmaker.\n\nIndian English Poetry is the oldest form of Indian English Literature.  Indian poets writing in English have succeeded to nativize or indianize English in order to reveal typical Indian situations.  Henry Louis Vivian Derozio is considered the first poet in the lineage of Indian English poetry followed by Sri Aurobindo, Sarojini Naidu, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Toru Dutt among others.  Among the contemporary Indian English Poets, Nar Deo Sharma occupies important place because of his literary achievements.\n\nThe Harshacharita (Sanskrit: हर्षचरित , Harṣacarita ) (\"The deeds of Harsha\"), is the biography of Indian emperor Harsha by Banabhatta, also known as Bana, who was a Sanskrit writer of seventh-century CE India.

All martial arts practiced in Tỉnh (State or Province) Binh Dinh is called Võ Bình Định.  There are 11 huyện (Counties or Districts) in the Binh Dinh Region that practices martial arts with villages and cities within each counties that contain style ranging anywhere from 100 to 600 years old.  Counties in the Bình Định Province include Phù Mỹ, Huyện Phù Cát, huyện Tây Sơn, huyện An Lão,huyện Hoài Nhơn, Hoài Ân, Huyện Vĩnh Thạnh , huyện Vân Canh, Quy Nhơn, Tuy Phước, and An Nhơn.  Three famous villages include Thuận Truyền, and An Vinh both which are located in the Tây Sơn district along with An Thái which is in the An Nhơn district.  Thuận Truyền Village and An Vinh Village style of Võ Bình Định is often considered as Võ Tây Sơn or also called Võ cổ truyền meaning Traditional Vietnamese Martial Arts and in the eastern district An Nhơn is An Thái style which is considered Võ Tàu or Chinese Martial Arts.  There is an old saying in the Binh Dinh Region which goes \"Roi Thuận Truyền, Quyền An Vinh\" which means the Thuận Truyền Quyền village is famous for Staff Techniques and An Vinh Village is famous for empty hand forms.  An Thái village is also famous empty hand forms along with its various Chinese Martial Arts that is influenced into Vietnamese martial arts.  Another saying in the Binh Dinh Province is \"Trai An Thái, gái An Vinh\" meaning that males practice An Thái style and females practice An Vinh style.  The reason for this saying is because the An Thái style utilizes more power in the empty hand forms making it more suitable when performed by a male.  Vietnamese people are typically smaller in stature and the An Vinh style assumes that the opponent is not Vietnamese making them possibly taller and stronger.  With a height and strength advantage An Vinh Style utilizes speed to overwhelm their opponents which can be seen in their empty hand forms and is more suited towards female fighters.

He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb.  Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.\n\nThe Three Rivers Computer Corporation (3RCC) was a spinoff from the Research Engineering Laboratory of the Computer Science Department of Carnegie-Mellon University, and was founded in May 1974 by Brian S. Rosen, James R. Teter, William H. Broadley, J. Stanley Kriz, D. Raj Reddy and Paul G. Newbury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States to manufacture advanced technology computer displays, peripherals, and systems.  Early products included: the GDP/2A Graphics Display processor with high speed vector generator capable of drawing in excess of 50,000 vectors at 60 Hz refresh rates; a CVD/2 Color Video Display System that displayed a full color raster scanned image with a unique data compression algorithm capable of full frame animation display; ADA-16 Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog converters for high fidelity music and speech research, and a UMB-11 Unibus Monitor that was a low-cost test instrument for PDP-11 series minicomputers.  In 1979, the company launched its principal products, a line of workstation computers called PERQ, which were single-user high performance workstations with the power of a medium-scale mainframe computer from that era coupled with a versatile graphics display.  In the summer of 1980, the company divested itself of all activities other than those related to PERQ.

It was announced by Sigma Corporation on February 10, 2015.\n\nIn cinematography, full frame refers to the use of the full film gate at maximum width and height for 35 mm film cameras.  It is sometimes also referred to as silent aperture, full gate, or a number of other similar word combinations.  It is the original gate size pioneered by William Dickson and Thomas Edison in 1892 and first used in the short film \"Blacksmithing Scene\".  Full frame is generally used by all 4-perf films, whether silent, standard 35 (Academy ratio width), or Super 35.  The introduction of Academy ratio in 1932 required that the lens mount needed to be shifted slightly horizontally to re-center the lens at the new center of frame; however, the gate size did not change as the extra negative information would be cropped out by lab processes in post-production.  4-perf Super 35 is nearly identical to the original full frame standard, although the lens mount requires vertical re-centering when common topline extraction is used.  It should also be noted that hard mattes for all common ratios exist and either replace the film gate itself or are inserted within it.  However, these are usually not used in the event that any reframing needs to be done.\n\nThe Nikon D4S is a full frame professional DSLR camera announced by Nikon Corporation on February 25, 2014 to succeed the D4 as its flagship DSLR.

{"question": "Elymus and Macropidia, are which type of mutual multicellular organisms?", "golden_answers": ["plants"], "context": "Elymus is a genus of perennial plants with approximately 150 species in the grass family, related to rye, wheat, and other widely grown cereal grains.\n\nChemotaxis (from \"chemo-\" + \"taxis\") is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus.  Somatic cells, bacteria, and other single-cell or multicellular organisms direct their movements according to certain chemicals in their environment.  This is important for bacteria to find food (e.g., glucose) by swimming toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons (e.g., phenol).  In multicellular organisms, chemotaxis is critical to early development (e.g., movement of sperm towards the egg during fertilization) and subsequent phases of development (e.g., migration of neurons or lymphocytes) as well as in normal function.  In addition, it has been recognized that mechanisms that allow chemotaxis in animals can be subverted during cancer metastasis.\n\nAn ocelloid is a subcellular structure found in the family \"Warnowiaceae\" (warnowiids), which are a members of a group of unicellular organisms known as dinoflagellates.  The ocelloid is analogous in structure and function to the eyes of multicellular organisms, which focus, process and detect light.  The ocelloid is much more complex than the eyespot, a light-sensitive structure also found in unicellular organisms, and is in fact one of the most complex known subcellular structures.  It has been described as a striking example of convergent evolution.\n\nThe mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms.  Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells).  A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.  To date, only one eukaryote, \"Monocercomonoides\", is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.  The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek \"μίτος\" , \"mitos\" , \"thread\", and \"χονδρίον\" , \"chondrion\" , \"granule\" or \"grain-like\".  Mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.\n\nMulticellular organisms are organisms that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to unicellular organisms.\n\nIn biology, axenic describes the state of a culture in which only a single species, variety, or strain of organism is present and entirely free of all other contaminating organisms.  The earliest axenic cultures were of bacteria or unicellular eukaryotes, but axenic cultures of many multicellular organisms are also possible.  Axenic culture is also an important tool for the study of symbiotic and parasitic organisms in a controlled manner.\n\nThe Ediacaran ( ; formerly Vendian) biota consisted of enigmatic tubular and frond-shaped, mostly sessile organisms that lived during the Ediacaran Period (ca. 635–542 Mya).  Trace fossils of these organisms have been found worldwide, and represent the earliest known complex multicellular organisms.  The Ediacaran biota radiated in an event called the Avalon explosion,   million years ago , after the Earth had thawed from the Cryogenian period's extensive glaciation.  The biota largely disappeared with the rapid increase in biodiversity known as the Cambrian explosion.  Most of the currently existing body plans of animals first appeared in the fossil record of the Cambrian rather than the Ediacaran.  For macroorganisms, the Cambrian biota appears to have completely replaced the organisms that dominated the Ediacaran fossil record, although relationships are still a matter of debate.\n\nIn biological taxonomy, a domain (Latin: \"regio\"), also superkingdom or empire, is the highest taxonomic rank of organisms in the three-domain system of taxonomy designed by Carl Woese, an American microbiologist and biophysicist.  According to the Woese system, introduced in 1990, the tree of life consists of three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.  The first two are all prokaryotic microorganisms, or single-celled organisms whose cells have no nucleus.  All life that has a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, and multicellular organisms, is included in the Eukarya.  Stefan Luketa in 2012 proposed a five \"dominion\" system, adding two more to the above.\n\nMacropidia fuliginosa, the sole species of genus Macropidia, is a perennial rhizomatous flowering plant.  Commonly known as the black kangaroo paw, it is endemic to Southwest Australia, specifically from Perth to Geraldton in the north of the region.\n\nAbderrazak El Albani is a French-Moroccan sedimentologist, Professor at University of Poitiers at the Hydrasa laboratory (IC2MP - CNRS).  He is significant for having discovered the oldest known fossils of multicellular organisms in the 2.1 billion year-old black shales of the Paleoproterozoic Francevillian Group Fossil Formation in Gabon, which shed new light on the origin of multicellular organisms.", "id": "hotpotqa_125"}

Written on 8 February, the Act was assembled against people \"in the practice of assembling and marching together in procession in Ireland in a manner calculated to create and perpetuate animosities between different classes of Her Majesty's Subjects, and to endanger the public peace.\"  Actions such as using banners, emblems and flags constituted an offence, as did music \"calculated or tend to provoke animosity\".  Violation of the Act was classed as a misdemeanor.  The Act was strongly supported by Sir Robert Peel however opposed by other politicians such as Lord Claude Hamilton who argued that religious parades would also be outlawed, yet posed no threat.  The \"Party Emblems Act\" was passed in 1860 to further support this measure following further riots at Derrymacash.  The Act was \"grudgingly\" accepted by the Orangemen, however both the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Young Ireland movement, and related Fenian movements were less placated.  William Johnston of Ballykilbeg led a radical Orangemen group in defiance of the act during the 1860s, and was imprisoned – prompting strong demand for its repeal in 1867, which succeeded in 1872.  The issue and repeal of the Act is viewed as an important milestone by nationalist historians of Ireland, and is said to be an example of Irish suppression by the \"English\" government.  Peel, however, was one of a number of Members of Parliament who viewed the Act as a necessity to prevent Catholic and Protestant in-fighting rather than Irish nationalism as a whole.  Traditional, revisionist and post-revisionist historians have subsequently supported either viewpoint and the Act remains a controversial one.\n\nMajor General Chamlong Srimuang (Thai: จำลอง ศรีเมือง , born 5 July 1935) is a Thai activist and former politician.
