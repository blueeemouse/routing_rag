LC Subject Headings are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and disseminate documents.  LCSHs are applied to every item within a library’s collection, and facilitate a user’s access to items in the catalogue that pertain to similar subject matter.  If users could only locate items by ‘title’ or other descriptive fields, such as ‘author’ or ‘publisher’, they would have to expend an enormous amount of time searching for items of related subject matter, and undoubtedly miss locating many items because of the ineffective and inefficient search capability.\n\nThe Traffickers is a 2016 British-American 8-part investigative television series about the illegal trafficking of goods including precious minerals, fake pharmaceuticals, guns, endangered species, and humans.  It is produced by Lightbox, the production company founded by Simon Chinn, who won Oscars for the feature documentaries Man On Wire and Searching For Sugar Man, and Jonathan Chinn, an Emmy winner for American High.

It is located on the third floor of Beverley Street Public School, an elementary school for disabled children.  Subway II (as it is referred to by many students) offers an unconventional approach to schooling, with a more flexible schedule, and one on one sessions with teachers.  The school received its name from Subway Academy I, as it was an offshoot of that school.  Despite the name, it is not accessible by the subway, and most students take the Spadina streetcar via the Nassau Street stop to get to school.  Nearby landmarks include Kensington Market, the University of Toronto, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\nUrban iconography is a branch of iconography, a term used both extensively, to mean a collection of illustrations of a specific subject and, within art history, the study of the subject matter of figurative representations.  Iconology is more specifically concerned with the interpretation of the same subject matter.  According to Erwin Panofsky iconography aims to identify the primary and secondary subject matter, and therefore “in doing so, iconography is an invaluable help for the establishment of dates, provenance and, occasionally, authenticity; and it furnishes the necessary basis for all further interpretation”.\n\nPatentable, statutory or patent-eligible subject matter is subject matter which is susceptible of patent protection.  The laws or patent practices of many countries provide that certain subject-matter is excluded from patentability, even if the invention is novel and non-obvious.  Together with novelty, inventive step or nonobviousness, utility, and industrial applicability, the question of whether a particular subject matter is patentable is one of the substantive requirements for patentability.\n\nThe Imp is a zine about comics that was written and published by Daniel Raeburn during the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Each issue of the zine examined a single cartoonist or type of comic in depth, often incorporating interviews done by Raeburn with or about the subject.  Raeburn frequently took an idiosyncratic view of his subject matter in \"The Imp\"; in the introduction to the first issue he wrote that \"the fact that I don't know anything about comics can only help me to take them seriously.\"  He frequently described his personal experiences with his subject matter in irreverent terms and gave detailed accounts of the people and places he encountered while doing his research, in the manner of gonzo journalism.  \"The Imp\" is also notable for the unique design of each issue.\n\nMy Scientology Movie is a 2015 British documentary film about Scientology directed by John Dower, and written by and starring Louis Theroux.  The film takes an unconventional approach to the subject matter, featuring young actors \"auditioning\" for parts playing high-profile Scientologists in scenes recreating accounts from ex-members about incidents involving senior church management.  The Church of Scientology responded by putting the filmmakers under surveillance and denouncing the film.\n\nThe New School of Monmouth County is a private school for grades K-8 located in Holmdel Township, New Jersey.  Founded in 1969 by Dr. Susan Chilvers, The New School employs a \"project approach\" to curriculum.  Rather than dividing subject matter into discrete timeslots, units and individual facts, instructors draw together academic subjects into large scale projects, incorporating the interests and ideas of the students along the way.  Plans for projects may be generated by one child, a group, a teacher, or a parent, and may end up involving just one individual, the entire school, or any sized group in between.  This approach ensures that students don't get bored or \"burned out,\" while simultaneously empowering them in many ways.  It also makes their work and their time more meaningful to them, and results in a deeper understanding of concepts, as opposed to a mere retention of data.  Our students learn to take ownership for planning and carrying through on their work, and they find satisfaction in their own processes, as opposed to finding it merely in the approval of others.  Creative play and problem solving are an integral part of the learning process.\n\nThe California Subject Examinations for Teachers, also abbreviated as CSET, is a group of subject matter tests used in California and other states to assess mastery of subject matter content by prospective K-12 teachers.

The project, initially code-named VK 70.01 (K), never left the drawing board, and was dropped in 5–6 March 1942, in favor of Porsche's heavier Panzer VIII Maus.\n\nAn infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), or infantry combat vehicle (ICV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide direct fire support.  According to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, an infantry fighting vehicle is \"an armoured combat vehicle which is designed and equipped primarily to transport a combat infantry squad, and which is armed with an integral or organic cannon of at least 20 millimeters calibre and sometimes an antitank missile launcher\".  They often serve as both the principal weapons system and mode of transport for a mechanized infantry unit.\n\nPanzerkampfwagen VIII Maus (\"Mouse\") was a German World War II super-heavy tank completed in late 1944.  It is the heaviest fully enclosed armoured fighting vehicle ever built.  Five were ordered, but only two hulls and one turret were completed before the testing grounds were captured by the advancing Soviet forces.\n\nThe Marder (German for \"marten\") is a German infantry fighting vehicle operated by the German Army as the main weapon of the Panzergrenadiere (mechanized infantry) from the 1970s through to the present day.  Developed as part of the rebuilding of Germany's armoured fighting vehicle industry, the Marder has proven to be a successful and solid infantry fighting vehicle design.  While it does include a few unique features, such as the fully remote machine gun on the rear deck, it is overall a simple and conventional machine with rear exit hatch and side gun ports for mounted infantry to fire through.  The Marder is currently being replaced by its successor, the Puma.\n\nThe Kubinka Tank Museum is a large military museum in Kubinka, Odintsovsky District, Moscow Oblast, Russia where tanks, armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs) and their relevant information are displayed and showcased.  The museum consists of open-air and indoor permanent exhibitions of many famous tanks and armored vehicles from throughout the 20th and 21st centuries (between 1917 to the present day).  It is also known to house and display many unique and one-of-a-kind military vehicles, such as the Nazi German Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank, the Troyanov heavy tank and a Karl-Gerät heavy self-propelled artillery, amongst other single or limited-production prototypes from the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.\n\nKampfwagenkanone (short: KwK / literal translation de ⇒ en: \"fighting vehicle cannon\") was the designation to any type of tank gun mounted in an armoured fighting vehicle or infantry fighting vehicle of the Nazi-Wehrmacht until 1945.  The wording was derived from the German nouns \"Kampfwagen\" (fighting vehicle) and \"Kanone\" (cannon or gun).  However, the present-day designation in German speaking armed forces to this particular weapon system is Panzerkanone (en: tank gun).\n\nPanzer (] ) is a German word that means armour.  It is also used by German-speakers as an abbreviation meaning \"\"armoured fighting vehicle\"\" or tank (the military vehicle).

The word \"Panzer\" is occasionally used in English and some other languages as a loanword in the context of the German military.\n\nThe BA-64 (\"БА-64\", from \"Bronirovaniy Avtomobil\", literally \"armoured car\") was a Soviet four-wheeled armoured scout car.  Built on the chassis of a GAZ-64 or GAZ-67 jeep, it incorporated a hull loosely modeled after that of the SdKfz 221.  The BA-64 was developed between July and November 1941 to replace the BA-20 then in service with armoured car units of the Red Army.  Cheap and exceptionally reliable, it would later become the most common Soviet wheeled armoured fighting vehicle to enter service during World War II, with over 9,000 being manufactured before production ended.\n\nThe \"Landkreuzer\" P. 1000 \"Ratte\" (English: \"Land Cruiser P. 1000 \"Rat\"\") was a design for a super-heavy tank for use by Nazi Germany during World War II, proposed by Krupp director Edward Grotte in June 1942, who had already named it \"\"Landkreuzer\"\".  Submitted designs and drawings of the tank went under the names \"OKH Auftrag Nr.  30404\" and \"E-30404/1\", which were presented in December 1942.  The tank was planned to be 1000 metric tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII \"Maus\", the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes).  The project gained the approval of Adolf Hitler, who had expressed interest in the development of the tank, but was canceled by Minister of Armaments Albert Speer in early 1943.\n\nThe Al-Fahd is an armoured fighting vehicle used by the Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia.

{"question": "Are Il trovatore and Alcina both operas?", "golden_answers": ["yes"], "context": "Il trovatore (] ; Italian for \"The Troubadour\") is an opera in four acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto largely written by Salvadore Cammarano, based on the play \"El trovador\" (1836) by Antonio García Gutiérrez.  It was Gutiérrez's most successful play, one which Verdi scholar Julian Budden describes as \"a high flown, sprawling melodrama flamboyantly defiant of the Aristotelian unities, packed with all manner of fantastic and bizarre incident.\"\n\nAlcina (HWV 34) is an opera seria by George Frideric Handel.  Handel used the libretto of \"L'isola di Alcina\", an opera that was set in 1728 in Rome by Riccardo Broschi, which he acquired the year after during his travels in Italy.  Partly altered for better conformity, the story was originally taken from Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\" (like those of the Handel operas \"Orlando\" and \"Ariodante\"), an epic poem.  The opera contains several musical sequences with opportunity for dance: these were composed for dancer Marie Sallé.\n\nGiovanni Guicciardi (12 January 1819 – 4 October 1883) was an Italian opera singer who sang leading baritone roles in the opera houses of Italy and Portugal.  He is most remembered today for having created the role of Count di Luna in Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", although he created several other leading roles in operas by lesser known Italian composers.  He accumulated a considerable fortune during the course of his career.  After his retirement from the stage, he taught without payment in music schools in his native city, Reggio Emilia, and presided over a charity for orphaned musicians.  He died in San Polo d'Enza at the age of 64.\n\nGaetano Fraschini (16 February 1816 – 23 May 1887) was an Italian tenor.  He created many roles in 19th century operas, including five composed by Giuseppe Verdi.  His voice was \"heroic ... with a baritonal quality, ... yet Verdi and Donizetti appreciated his ability to sing softly and with subtlety.\"  An Italian biographer has pointed out Fraschini's role in extending the longevity of Donizetti's operas, while at the same time accelerating the ascent of Verdi's repertory.  He was indeed the most prominent singer who facilitated the transition from Donizetti to Verdi.  Fraschini sang over one hundred roles and Verdi placed him at the top of his favorite tenors' list and described him as a \"natural Manrico\" for his \"Il trovatore\".  Fraschini also played a pivotal role in the success of many operas by Pacini and Mercadante.\n\nRolando Panerai (born 17 October 1924) is an Italian baritone, particularly associated with the Italian repertory.  He was born in Campi Bisenzio, near Florence, Italy and studied with Frazzi in Florence and Armani and Giulia Tess in Milan.  Panerai made his stage debut in 1947 in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo as the pharaon in Rossini's \"Mosè in Egitto\".  Other debuts, both in 1951, were as Simon Boccanegra in \"Simon Boccanegra\" in Bergamo and as Sharpless in \"Madama Butterfly\" at La Scala in Milan.  He sang in many rarely performed Verdi operas on radio broadcast for RAI in 1951 (to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Verdi's death), such as \"Giovanna d'Arco\", \"La battaglia di Legnano\", and \"Aroldo\".  Later roles included most of the great Verdi baritone roles, particularly the title character in \"Rigoletto\", The Count of Luna in \"Il trovatore\", Giorgio Germont in \"La traviata\", Marquis of Posa in \"Don Carlos\", Amonasro in \"Aida\".\n\nFrank Guarrera (December 3, 1923 – November 23, 2007) was an Italian-American lyric baritone who enjoyed a long and distinguished career at the Metropolitan Opera, singing with the company for a total of 680 performances.  He performed 35 different roles at the Met, mostly from the Italian and French repertories, from 1948 through 1976.  His most frequent assignments at the house were as Escamillo in Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\", Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's \"La Bohème\", Valentin in Charles Gounod's \"Faust\", and Ping in Puccini's \"Turandot\".  He was also an admired interpreter of Mozart roles, establishing himself in the parts of both Guglielmo and Don Alfonso in \"Così fan tutte\" and Count Almaviva in \"Le nozze di Figaro\".  Most of the roles he portrayed were from the lyric repertoire, such as the title role in Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\", but he also sang some heavier roles at the Met like Amonasro in \"Aïda\", Jack Rance in \"La fanciulla del West\" and Il conte di Luna in \"Il trovatore\".\n\nThis is a partial discography of Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Il trovatore\" (\"The Troubadour\") and \"Le trouvère\" (the revised version in French translation).

Of these, 45 are live audio recordings, 22 are studio audio recordings, and 16 are videos or movies.  \"Il trovatore\" was first performed at the Teatro Apollo, Rome on 19 January 1853.  \"Le trouvère\" was first presented on 12 January 1857.\n\nCorrado Zambelli (3 June 1897 - 1 September 1974) was an Italian classical bass who had an active international singing career in operas and concerts from the 1920s through the 1950s.  He appears on several complete opera recordings, including \"Otello\" and \"Carmen\" for His Master's Voice; and \"Ernani\", \"Il trovatore\", \"La favorite\", and \"La Gioconda\" for Columbia Records.\n\nFerrucio Calusio (1889 or 1890 - 3 June 1983) was an Argentine conductor.  He began his career in the 1920s at La Scala in Milan, Italy as an assistant conductor to Arturo Toscanini.  In 1927 he returned to his native country to join the conducting staff of the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.  He served as one of that house's main conductors in the Italian repertoire through 1960.  He also worked as a guest conductor with several important opera houses during his career, including conducting several operas at La Scala in the 1930s and at the Metropolitan Opera (\"Cavalleria rusticana\", \"Pagliacci\", and \"Il trovatore\") in 1940-1941.  In 1939 he conducted the orchestra of La Scala for the first recording of Claudio Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\".  He died in Buenos Aires at the age of 93.\n\nVincenzo Moscuzza (1827–1896) was an Italian composer.  Born in Syracuse, Sicily, he was the son of composer Luigi Moscuzza, and his initial musical training was from his father.  He later studied at the Naples Conservatory with Saverio Mercadante.  He is chiefly known for his many operas, of which his most successful were \"Stradella il trovatore\" (1850), \"Don Carlo\" (1862), and \"Gonzales Davila\" (1869).

Stouts were traditionally the generic term for the strongest or stoutest porters, typically 7% or 8%, produced by a brewery.\n\nBeer in Mexico has a long history.  While Mesoamerican cultures knew of fermented alcoholic beverages, including a corn beer, long before the Spanish conquest, European style beer brewed with barley was introduced with the Spanish soon after Hernán Cortés’s arrival.  Production of this beer here was limited during the colonial period due to the lack of materials and severe restrictions and taxes placed on the product by Spanish authorities.  After the Mexican War of Independence, these restrictions disappeared, and the industry was permitted to develop.  Furthermore, the arrival of German immigrants and the short-lived empire of Austrian Maximilian I in the 19th century provided the impetus for the opening of many breweries in various parts of the country.  By 1918, there were 36 brewing companies, but over the 20th century, the industry consolidated until today, only two corporations, Grupo Modelo and FEMSA control 90% of the Mexican beer market.  This industry is one of the most prevalent in the country, with over 63% of the population buying one brand or another.  Beer is also a major export for the country, with most going to the United States, but is available in over 150 countries in the world.\n\nVermonster is an American barley wine style beer brewed by the Rock Art Brewery in Morrisville, Vermont.  This beer was created by Matt Nadeau, the owner of Rock Art Brewery, in celebration of the brewery's 10th anniversary.  The beer was created with the theme of \"Tens\" in that it contains 10% ABV, 100 International Bitterness Units, and 110 pounds of malt per barrel.\n\nWeyerbacher Brewing Company is a brewery in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States, founded in 1995 by Dan and Sue Weirback.  The brewery is well known for its \"huge taste\" beers.  Most of their brews are high in alcohol, with QUAD clocking in at 11.8% alcohol by volume, and a one-off 10th anniversary ale called Decadence brewed to 13% alcohol by volume.  Hops Infusion is one of the bitterest examples of the IPA style.  Weyerbacher is also a pioneer of aging beer in wooden barrels previously used for aging bourbon.  This process was used to transform Old Heathen imperial stout into Heresy, Blithering Idiot barley wine into Insanity, Merry Monks Belgian tripel into Prophecy, and QUAD Belgian quadrupel into Blasphemy.  These four styles are all very high-alcohol brews with complex flavor profiles; the barrel-aging lends additional oak and whiskey flavors.  The results have been widely praised by fans of huge beers, though persons accustomed to more mainstream beer may find them an acquired taste.\n\nBarley wine is a style of strong ale of between 6-16% alcohol by volume.\n\nVelebitsko is a popular beer brand from Croatia, brewed near Gospić on the Velebit mountains in Lika by the Pivovara Ličanka.  The name is used for the pale lager which has an alcohol content of 5.1% and for the dark lager which has an alcohol content of 6.0%.  Known for its high quality brewery, the dark beer has been voted best beer by an English beer expert website.\n\nStout is a dark beer made using roasted malts or roast barley.\n\nOld ale is a term commonly applied to dark, malty beers in England, generally above 5% abv, also to dark ales of any strength in Australia.  Sometimes associated with \"stock ale\" or, archaically, \"keeping ale\", in which the beer is held at the brewery.\n\nBeer is produced in Armenia since ancient times.  In the 5th century BC, after arriving in a village in Ancient Armenia (possibly in the territory of Artsakh), Xenophon wrote in the Anabasis that \"There were stored wheat, barley, vegetables, and barley wine in the craters (clay pots).  In upper level of vessels with the edges in the wine floated barley, and there was stuck a reed, large and small sizes and who wanted to drink, had to taken a reed in his mouth and pull it through the wine.  Not mixed with water, the wine was very strong, but for local people it was a very pleasant drink\".\n\nBeer in China has become increasingly popular in the last century due to the popularity of Zhujiang Beer and China Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Chinese beer has also seen a rise in popularity internationally in the last few decades.  While most Chinese beers are pale lagers, other styles are occasionally found, such as Tsingtao Dark Beer.", "id": "hotpotqa_11"}

{"question": "Which Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer produced music for the French opera Thésée?", "golden_answers": ["Jean-Baptiste Lully"], "context": "Jules Danilo (born 18 May 1995 in Milan, Italy) is an Italian-born French Grand Prix motorcycle racer.  He has also previously competed in the French 125cc/Moto3 championship – twice finishing as runner-up in the series – and the CEV Moto3 series.\n\nNino Frank (born 27 June 1904 in Barletta, Italy − Paris, 17 August 1988) was an Italian-born French film critic and writer who was most active in the 1930s and 1940s.  Frank is best known for being the first film critic to use the term \"film noir\" to refer to 1940s US crime drama films such as \"The Maltese Falcon,\" although research indicates that the term was used in French film reviews and newspaper articles in 1938 and 1939.\n\nJean-Philippe Rameau (] ; (1683--)25 1683 – (1764--)12 1764 ) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era.  He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin.\n\nAlfred Rode (4 June 1905 – 22 July 1979) was an Italian-born French composer, musician, actor and film director.  He was born in Torre del Greco as Alfred Spedaliere.  In 1936 Rode appeared in the British film \"Gypsy Melody\" alongside Lupe Velez, which was a remake of his own 1935 film \"Juanita\".  Rode was married to the French actress Claudine Dupuis from 1951.\n\nJean-Baptiste Lully (] ; born Giovanni Battista Lulli ] ; 28 November 1632 – 22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France.  He is considered a master of the French baroque style.  Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period.  He became a French subject in 1661.\n\nThésée (\"Theseus\") is a \"tragédie en musique\", an early type of French opera, in a prologue and five acts with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and a libretto by Philippe Quinault based on Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".  It was first performed on 11 January 1675 by the Paris Opera for the royal court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was first performed in public in April at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris.\n\nUrbain Caffi (10 January 1917 – 16 March 1991) was an Italian-born French racing cyclist.  He won the French national road race title in 1944.  He also rode in the 1947 and 1948 Tour de France.\n\nThésée (\"Theseus\") is an opera by the French composer Jean-Joseph de Mondonville, first performed at Fontainebleau on 7 November 1765.  It takes the form of a \"tragédie en musique\" in five acts.  The opera is a new setting of a libretto by Philippe Quinault, originally set by Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1675.  Mondonville's version was not a success and did not get to enjoy its public premiere at the Paris Opera until 13 January 1767, but audience rejected it calling for the restoration of Lully's original music.  Mondonville's opera was withdrawn for good after its fourth performance.\n\nPietro Paolo Savorgnan di Brazzà, then known as Pierre Paul François Camille Savorgnan de Brazza (26 January 1852 – 14 September 1905), was an Italian-born French explorer.  With the backing of the Société de Géographie de Paris, he opened up for France entry along the right bank of the Congo that eventually led to French colonies in Central Africa.  His easy manner and great physical charm, as well as his pacific approach among Africans, were his trademarks.  Under French colonial rule, the capital of the Republic of the Congo was named Brazzaville after him and the name was retained by the post-colonial rulers.\n\nGluck set the same libretto Philippe Quinault had written for Lully in 1686, based on Torquato Tasso's \"Gerusalemme liberata\" (\"Jerusalem Delivered\").  Gluck seemed at ease in facing French traditions head-on when he composed \"Armide\".  Lully and Quinault were the very founders of serious opera in France and \"Armide\" was generally recognized as their masterpiece, so it was a bold move on Gluck's part to write new music to Quinault's words.  A similar attempt to write a new opera to the libretto of \"Thésée\" by Jean Joseph de Mondonville in 1765 had ended in disaster, with audiences demanding it be replaced by Lully's original.  By utilizing \"Armide\", Gluck challenged the long-standing and apparently inviolable ideals of French practice, and in the process he revealed these values capable of renewal through \"modern\" compositional sensitivities.  Critical response and resultant polemic resulted in one of those grand imbroglios common to French intellectual life.  Gluck struck a nerve in French sensitivities, and whereas \"Armide\" was not one of his more popular works, it remained a critical touchstone in the French operatic tradition and was warmly praised by Berlioz in his \"Memoirs\".  Gluck also set a minor fashion for resetting Lully/Quinault operas: Gluck's rival Piccinni followed his example with \"Roland\" in 1778 and \"Atys\" in 1780; in the same year, Philidor produced a new \"Persée\"; and Gossec offered his version of \"Thésée\" in 1782.  Gluck himself is said to have been working on an opera based on \"Roland\", but he abandoned it when he heard Piccinni had taken on the same libretto.", "id": "hotpotqa_23"}

{"question": " Lorenzo Ghiberti was an italian artist known as the creator of the bronze doors of a religious building that has the status of what?", "golden_answers": ["a minor basilica"], "context": "Lorenzo Ghiberti (] ; 1378 – 1 December 1455), born Lorenzo di Bartolo, was a Florentine Italian artist of the Early Renaissance best known as the creator of the bronze doors of the Florence Baptistery, called by Michelangelo the \"Gates of Paradise\".  Trained as a goldsmith and sculptor, he established an important workshop for sculpture in metal.  His book of \"Commentari\" contains important writing on art, as well as what may be the earliest surviving autobiography by any artist.\n\nSt. John the Baptist (1412–1416) is a bronze statue by Lorenzo Ghiberti located in one of the 14 niches of the Orsanmichele in Florence, Italy.  The statue of the Saint was commissioned by the cloth merchant's guild, the \"Arte di Calimala\".  The artist's use of the unnaturalistic but elegant curves in the hair and drapery of the saint show the influence of the International Gothic style prevalent in Italy at the time the work was created.  The work was successfully cast in a single piece, making it the first bronze statue of its size to be cast in a single piece for at least several hundred years in Italy.\n\nThe Florence Baptistery (Italian: \"Battistero di San Giovanni\" ), also known as the Baptistery of Saint John, is a religious building in Florence, Italy, and has the status of a minor basilica.  The octagonal baptistery stands in both the Piazza del Duomo and the Piazza San Giovanni, across from Florence Cathedral and the Campanile di Giotto.\n\nGhiberti is a crater on Mercury.  It has a diameter of 123 kilometers.  Its name was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1976.  Ghiberti is named for the Italian sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, who lived from 1378 to 1455.\n\nThe Tabernacle of the Linaioli (Italian: \"Tabernacolo dei Linaioli\", literally \"Tabernacle of the Linen manufacturers\") is a marble aedicula designed by Lorenzo Ghiberti, with paintings by Fra Angelico, dating to 1432-1433.  It is housed in the National Museum of San Marco, Florence, central Italy.\n\nAnsano di Andrea di Bartolo (1421–1491) was an Italian painter active in Siena.  After a brief spell in the late 1430s in Castiglione Olona (near Milan), as an assistant in Masolino’s workshop, he returned to Siena, where in the 1440s he quickly established him- self as one of the most progressive artists in the city.  This was a time when the Renaissance avant-garde of Sienese painters, headed by Domenico di Bartolo and Lorenzo Vecchietta, were eagerly assimilating the innovations of the leading Florentine artists of the early Renaissance.  Following in the footsteps of the leading Florentine painters and sculptors – Masaccio, Masolino, Filippo Lippi, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello – they reformed the traditional formulas of Sienese painting without breaking with their own well-established traditions.  These artists permeated their old Sienese formulas and inventions with a Renaissance spirit and produced pictures of major physical substance, consequently scenes of higher empathy, and, in the case of the splendid frescoes of the Pellegrinaio of the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Scala in Siena, episodes embedded in fantastic architectural settings, constructed as eccentric expressions of the newly acquired rules of perspective within an artistic vocabulary of no lesser eccentricity inspired by the classical world.\n\nParri Spinelli (ca. 1387–1453) was an Italian (Tuscan) painter of the early renaissance who was born in the Province of Arezzo.  His father and teacher was Spinello Aretino (1350–1410), who was active throughout Tuscany.  Parri Spinelli lived in Florence from 1411 or 1412 to 1419, and was a member of the workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti.  He became the most important painter in Arezzo upon his return.  Spinelli died in 1453 in Arezzo Province.  His paintings are notable for their bold colors and figures that are more elongated than those of his predecessors.\n\nAfter years of considering options, Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti were made joint leaders of the project to build the dome for Florence Cathedral in 1420.  Brunelleschi's plan to use suspended scaffolding for the workers won out over alternatives such as building a provisional stone support column in the center of the crossing or filling the space with earth.  The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433.  The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death.  It was completed in 1467.  He had also planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today.  Although a portion of it was constructed on the southeast side beginning in 1508, work stopped after the visual effect was criticized by Michelangelo.\n\nGiovanni dal Ponte (1385 – ca. 1438, Florence) was a Florentine minor master painter of the late-Gothic period, known as one of the greatest minor masters contemporary to Masaccio.  He is known by Giorgio Vasari as dal Ponte, a name derived from the location of his studio at the Piazza di Santo Stefano a Ponte.  Many other documents cite his name as Giovanni di Marco.  After joining the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali in 1410 and the Compagnia di S Luca in 1413, dal Ponte opened his studio in the late 1420s and hired Florentine painter Smeraldo di Giovanni as his assistant.  Smeraldo was hired after dal Ponte was imprisoned in 1424 due to failure to repay his debts, with the intention that Smeraldo would manage the logistical aspects of the workshop in addition to his artwork.  Dal Ponte used his craftsmanship to create not only Panel paintings, but also frescoes and decorations for small objects.  Dal Ponte's work is considered to be of the Late Gothic style, though he assimilated the stylistic preferences of his contemporaries; Lorenzo Monaco, Masaccio, and Lorenzo Ghiberti served as his primary influences.\n\nBernardo Cennini (] ; 1414/5 – c. 1498) was an Italian goldsmith, sculptor and early printer of Florence.  As a sculptor he was among the assistants to Lorenzo Ghiberti in the long project producing the second pair of doors—the \"Doors of Paradise\"—for the Battistero di San Giovanni.  He produced the first book printed at Florence.  The painter and author of a famous book on the crafts, Cennino D'Andrea Cennini, was a member of the same Florentine family.", "id": "hotpotqa_29"}

{"question": "Which popular Mexican singer and movie actor is known for his rancheras, a genre of traditional Mexican folk music?", "golden_answers": ["Javier Solís"], "context": "Los Soneritos is a group dedicated to Mexican folk music and dance, founded in 2005 in Colima by Omar Alejandro Rojas Ramos.  Rojas Ramos formed the group while working at a primary school, giving classes in music and dance.  It was formed with the express intention of preserving and promoting folk music and dance to youths and children.  The group mostly performs music and dance from its home state of Veracruz such as son, fandango and zapateado, but other similar music such as son from the west of Mexico and the “mitote folkorico” is also in the repertoire.  Members of the group have done research about traditional music and dance as well as composed their own original pieces.\n\nYu-Mex (portmanteau of \"Yugoslav\" and \"Mexican\") was a style of popular music in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which incorporated the elements of traditional Mexican music.  The style was mostly popular during the 1950s and 60s, when a string of Yugoslav singers began to perform traditional Mexican songs.\n\nRanchera (] ), or canción ranchera is a genre of the traditional music of Mexico.  It dates before the years of the Mexican Revolution.  It later became closely associated with the \"mariachi\" groups which evolved in Jalisco.  Ranchera today is also played by norteño (or Conjunto) or banda and Tamborazo.  Drawing on rural traditional folk music, ranchera developed as a symbol of a new national consciousness in reaction to the aristocratic tastes of the period.  Some well-known interpreters of the genre are the following singers: Amalia Mendoza, Antonio Aguilar, Chelo, Cuco Sánchez, Flor Silvestre, Irma Serrano, Javier Solís, Jorge Negrete, José Alfredo Jiménez, Lola Beltrán, Lucha Villa, Pedro Infante, Rocío Dúrcal, Vicente Fernández and presently, Pedro Fernández and, Pepe Aguilar.\n\nFrontiers is the sixth studio album by Jesse Cook.  According to Cook's official web page, inspiration for the album came from a \"temporary move with his wife to Seville, Spain\" and the birth of his first child, Lucas Cook (b. March 14, 2005).  Cook and nine other musicians recorded the album at Coach House Music in Canada.  The album was mixed by Cook.  All songs were written by Jesse Cook except \"It Ain't Me Babe\", which is a cover version of the original song by Bob Dylan, and La Llorona, a traditional Mexican folk song.\n\nContemporary folk music refers to a wide variety of genres that emerged in the mid 20th century and afterwards which were associated with traditional folk music.  Starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music.  This process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s.  The most common name for this new form of music is also \"folk music\", but is often called \"contemporary folk music\" or \"folk revival music\" to make the distinction.  The transition was somewhat centered in the US and is also called the American folk music revival.  Fusion genres such as folk rock, folktronica, and others also evolved within this phenomenon.  While contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music, it often shares the same English name, performers and venues as traditional folk music; even individual songs may be a blend of the two.\n\n\"To Ramona\" is a folk waltz written by Bob Dylan for his fourth studio album, \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\".  The melody is taken from traditional Mexican folk music.  \"To Ramona\" is also a nod to Rex Griffin's 1937 song \"The Last Letter\".  The song is one of several on the album to highlight the more personal, less political, side of Dylan's songwriting that would become more prominent in the future.

{"question": "The astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis co-authored what landmark paper?", "golden_answers": ["BFH"], "context": "With the formation of stars, heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and helium by stellar nucleosynthesis, a process that continues today.  Some of these elements, particularly those lighter than iron, continue to be delivered to the interstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer envelope before they collapse to form white dwarfs.  The remains of their ejected mass form the planetary nebulae observable throughout our galaxy.\n\nThe BFH paper, named after the initials of the authors of the paper, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler, and Fred Hoyle, is a landmark paper of stellar physics published in \"Reviews of Modern Physics\" in 1957.  The formal title of the paper is \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\", but the article is generally referred to only as \"BFH\".\n\nStellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which the natural abundances of the chemical elements within stars change due to nuclear fusion reactions in the cores and their overlying mantles.  Stars are said to evolve (age) with changes in the abundances of the elements within.  Core fusion increases the atomic weight of elements and reduces the number of particles, which would lead to a pressure loss except that gravitation leads to contraction, an increase of temperature, and a balance of forces.  A star loses most of its mass when it is ejected late in the star's lifetime, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium.  The term supernova nucleosynthesis is used to describe the creation of elements during the evolution and explosion of a pre-supernova star, a concept put forth by Fred Hoyle in 1954.  A stimulus to the development of the theory of nucleosynthesis was the discovery of variations in the abundances of elements found in the universe.  Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number of the element, have a jagged sawtooth shape that varies by factors of tens of millions.  This suggested a natural process that is not random.  Such a graph of the abundances can be seen at History of nucleosynthesis theory article.  Of the several processes of nucleosynthesis, stellar nucleosynthesis is the dominating contributor to elemental abundances in the universe.\n\nGeorge Gamow (March 4 [O.S. February 20] 1904 August 19, 1968), born Georgiy Antonovich Gamov (Russian: Гео́ргий Анто́нович Га́мов ; ] ), was a theoretical physicist and cosmologist.  He was an early advocate and developer of Lemaître's Big Bang theory.  He discovered a theoretical explanation of alpha decay via quantum tunneling, and worked on radioactive decay of the atomic nucleus, star formation, stellar nucleosynthesis and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis), and molecular genetics.\n\nHans Albrecht Bethe (] ; July 2, 1906 – March 6, 2005) was a German and American nuclear physicist who, in addition to making important contributions to astrophysics, quantum electrodynamics and solid-state physics, won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.\n\nJohn Allen \"Jack\" Eddy (March 25, 1931 – June 10, 2009) was an American astronomer who published professionally under the name John A. Eddy but much of the content referencing him can be found under his nickname Jack which he preferred to use.  In 1976 Dr. Eddy published a landmark paper in Science titled \"The Maunder Minimum\" where, using the Nineteenth Century works of Edward W. Maunder and Gustav Spörer, he identified a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715 as a time when solar activity all but stopped.  In making the case for the anomaly, he gathered and interpreted data from a wide variety of sources, including first-hand accounts from extant historical observations of the Sun going back to the telescopic observations of Galileo and other contemporary scientists of the 17th and early 18th centuries; from historical reports of the aurora borealis observed in past centuries in Europe and the New World; from visual observations of sunspots seen with the unaided eye at sunrise and sunset in dynastic records from the Orient; from existing descriptions of the eclipsed Sun; and from measurements of carbon-14 in dated tree-rings.  In the last of these, which can be used as a proxy indicator of solar activity, he found evidence of other similar periods of solar quiescence in the distant past, the most recent an even longer 90-year span, from about 1460 until 1550, which he named the Spörer Minimum.  Both the Maunder and Spörer minima fell during the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age, which suggested a meaningful connection between the longer term behavior of the Sun and of the Earth’s mean surface temperature.  In advancing the theory that the Sun is a variable star Eddy observed: \"It has long been thought that the Sun is a constant star of regular and repeatable behavior.  Measurements of the radiative output, or solar constant, seem to justify the first assumption, and the record of periodicity in sunspot numbers is taken as evidence of the second.  Both records, however, sample only the most recent history of the Sun.\"\n\nBoron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5.  Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust.  Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.  These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.  The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.\n\nNeutron capture nucleosynthesis describes two nucleosynthesis pathways: the r-process and the s-process, for \"rapid\" and \"slow\" neutron captures, respectively.  R-process describes neutron capture in a region of high neutron flux, such as during supernova nucleosynthesis after core-collapse, and yields neutron-rich nuclides.  S-process describes neutron capture that is slow relative to the rate of beta decay, as for stellar nucleosynthesis in some stars, and yields nuclei with stable nuclear shells.  Each process is responsible for roughly half of the observed abundances of elements heavier than iron.  The importance of neutron capture to the observed abundance of the chemical elements was first described in 1957 in the BFH paper.\n\nAlastair G. W. (Graham Walter) Cameron (21 June 1925 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada – 3 October 2005 in Tucson, Arizona, USA) was a Canadian astrophysicist and space scientist who was an eminent staff member of the Astronomy department of Harvard University.  Cameron, the son of a Canadian biochemist, was born in Winnipeg.  He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Manitoba, and a doctorate from the University of Saskatchewan in 1952.  In 1959 he emigrated to the USA, where he held academic positions at the California Institute of Technology, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and at Yeshiva University.  In 1973 he became a professor of astronomy at Harvard University and remained there for 26 years.  From 1976 to 1982 he was chairman of the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences.  He pioneered the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis – the production of chemical elements in stars.  He was also the first to theorize that the formation of the Moon was the result of an extraterrestrial impact on the early Earth by an object at least the size of Mars.\n\nSir Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915 – 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.  He also held controversial stances on other scientific matters—in particular his rejection of the \"Big Bang\" theory, a term coined by him on BBC radio, and his promotion of panspermia as the origin of life on Earth.  He also wrote science fiction novels, short stories and radio plays, and co-authored twelve books with his son, Geoffrey Hoyle.", "id": "hotpotqa_34"}

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a significant amount of Chinese emigration to North America originated from this four-counties area called Sze Yup, making Toishanese a dominant variety of the Chinese language spoken in Chinatowns in Canada and the United States.

Westernised Chinese lacks the characteristics of traditional Chinese writing, and sometimes poses reading or understanding difficulties to readers because of its awkwardness and/or wordiness.  It is probable that most Westernized Chinese translations are a very direct translation from English into Chinese by native Chinese speakers, given the virtually non-existent demand for native English speakers to perform written translation into Chinese.  In the first half of the 20th century, Lu Xun advocated that translations of Western works into Chinese closely follow the Western structure, but Lu Xun's arguments failed to be persuasive, and translators subsequently used a more natural translation style from English to Chinese.\n\nLisa Surihani binti Mohamed or better known as Lisa Surihani (born 23 March 1986) is a Malaysian actress, model, television host and commercial model.

The British historian Ian Kershaw wrote in the preface to his biography of Hitler: \"For all the caution which must naturally be attached to Goebbels's regularly reported remarks by Hitler ... the immediacy as well as the frequency of the comments makes them a vitally important source of insight into Hitler's thinking and action. \"\n\n\"Francoist Spain\" (also historically \"Nationalist Spain\" during the Spanish Civil War) refers to the period of Spanish history between 1939, when Francisco Franco took control of Spain from the government of the Second Spanish Republic after winning the civil war, and 1975, when Franco died and Prince Juan Carlos was proclaimed King of Spain.  During the Second World War, its entry into the war on the Axis side was prevented largely, as was much later revealed, by British Secret Intelligence Service (MI-6) efforts that included up to $200 million in bribes for Spanish officials to keep the regime from getting involved.  Franco was also able to take advantage of the resources of the Axis Powers and chose to avoid becoming heavily involved in the Second World War.  Franco's regime evolved into a more classic autocratic regime.\n\nCensorship in Francoist Spain was mandated by Francisco Franco during his reign, between 1936-1975.  Under his regime, primary subjects of censorship included public display of liberal political ideology, art forms such as literature and film, as well as symbols of foreign, non-conservative ideologies.  This censorship was primarily driven by Franco's vision for ideological unity in Spain.  As a result, Franco called for the censorship of materials that promoted liberal ideas from abroad, particular those of European origin.  Aside from censorship of foreign ideology, symbols of Spanish identity, such as Catalonia, also became primary targets of censorship.  Under his authoritarian regime, censorship was imposed primarily through systemic political repression.  Franco's regime repressed expression of liberal social and political ideology among the Spanish public.", "id": "hotpotqa_51"}

Her builders went bankrupt shortly after she was laid down, which significantly delayed her completion.  After being launched in 1863, she waited a further five years to receive her guns due to supply issues.  Upon being commissioned in 1868 the ship was assigned as the First Reserve guard ship for Southern Ireland, where she remained until she was decommissioned in 1885.  \"Valiant\" was hulked in 1897 as part of the stoker training school HMS \"Indus\" before becoming a storeship for kite balloons during the First World War.  The ship was converted to a floating oil tank in 1926 and served in that role until sold for scrap in 1956.\n\nHMS \"Lowestoffe\" was a 28-gun \"Lowestoffe\"-class sixth-rate frigate of the Royal Navy.  Named after the UK's most easterly port of Lowestoft in Suffolk the ship was designed by Sir Thomas Slade based on the earlier \"Lyme\" of 1748, \"with such alterations as may tend to the better stowing of men and carrying for guns.\"  The design provided for a 24-gun ship (from 22 September 1756 this was raised to 28 guns by including the 3 pounders on the quarterdeck in the count) of 583 tons, but on completion the ship measured some 11 tons more.\n\nHMS \"James Watt\" was a 91-gun steam and sail-powered second rate ship of the line.

Both ships were reordered as screw propelled ships, \"James Watt\" in 1849, and \"Cressy\" in 1852.  \"James Watt\" became one of the four-ship \"Agamemnon\"-class of ships of the line.

It continued under RN operational and administrative command until March 1946.  With the end of the war, it reverted to Ceylon Government Control, though yet CRNVR in name.  In the 1939-1946 period, the CRNVR carried out several operational duties, mainly at sea.  Cutting its teeth on the Port Commission Tugs SAMSON and GOLIATH, it later manned and operated trawlers and Antarctic whalers converted as Minesweepers and fitted out with guns, submarine detection equipment and anti-submarine weaponry.

The double-breasted style is sometimes called a Prince Albert (after the consort to Queen Victoria).  The frock coat is a fitted, long-sleeved coat with a centre vent at the back, and some features unusual in post-Victorian dress.  These include the reverse collar and lapels, where the outer edge of the lapel is cut from a separate piece of cloth from the main body, and also a high degree of waist suppression, where the coat's diameter round the waist is much less than round the chest.  This is achieved by a high horizontal waist seam with side bodies, which are extra panels of fabric above the waist used to pull in the naturally cylindrical drape.\n\nThis list of Donald Duck universe characters focuses on Disney cartoon characters who typically appear with Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck, but are not related to them.

The \"Vetehinen\" class served in the Finnish Navy during World War II.  The class was designed by Dutch dummy company Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw den Haag (I.v.S) (set up by Germany after World War I in order to maintain and develop German submarine know-how and to circumvent the limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles) and built by the Finnish Crichton-Vulcan shipyard in Turku.  The class was based on the German World War I Type UB III and Type UC III submarines and served as prototype for Type VII submarines.\n\nKrab (\"Краб\" - Crab) was a submarine built for the Imperial Russian Navy.  She was designed by Mikhail Petrovich Nalyotov as the world's first submarine minelayer, although due to construction delays the German UC submarines entered service earlier.  The mines were stowed in two horizontal galleries exiting through the stern.  Diving depth was 45 metres.  This ship was built by the Naval yard in Nikolayev by the Black Sea (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine).  She was ordered in 1908, launched in September 1912 (or early 1913, sources differ) and entered service in 1915.\n\nThe United States L-class submarines were a class of 11 submarines built 1914–1917, and were the United States Navy's first attempt at designing and building ocean-going submarines.  At the time there was a significant gap in long-range submarine design compared with other major navies.  The \"Group 2\" L-boats designed by Lake Torpedo Boat Company (\"L-5\" through \"L-8\") were built to slightly different specifications from the other \"Group 1\" L-boats (which were designed by Electric Boat) and are sometimes considered a separate L-5 class.\n\nThe C-class submarines were five United States Navy submarines built by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in Quincy, Massachusetts, under a subcontract from the Electric Boat Company.  Built between 1906 and 1909, and in commission from 1908 to 1919, all five were subsequently sold for scrap in 1920.  They were considerably larger than the preceding B class at 275 tons submerged vs. 173 tons submerged, and were the first United States submarines with two-shaft propulsion, doubling the machinery of the B class.\n\nRobert W.

{"question": "Do the Vizsla and German Longhaired Pointer originate in the same country?", "golden_answers": ["no"], "context": "The Republic of the Congo (ROC) is a destination and transit country for children subjected to trafficking in persons for the purposes of forced labor and forced prostitution.  Most sources agree that up to 80 percent of all trafficked children originate from Benin, with girls comprising 90 percent of that group.  Togo, Mali, Guinea, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Senegal are also sources of victims found in the Congolese republic.  Internally trafficked children represent 10 percent of all child victims, the majority of which originate from the Pool region.  Many child victims are subjected to forced labor, including in domestic work, market vending and fishing; girls are also exploited in the sex trade.  Child victims generally experience harsh treatment, long work hours, and almost no access to education or health services; they receive little or no remuneration for their work.  Other village children, however, live voluntarily with extended relatives in cities, attend school, and do housework in exchange for food, in a traditional cultural and familial pattern that does not entail abuse.\n\nThe Pointer Sisters are an American R&B singing group from Oakland, California, that achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s.

The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions, in addition to being the smallest of the all-round pointer-retriever breeds.  The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics as a hunter of fowl and upland game, and through the centuries the Vizsla has held a rare position among sporting dogs – that of household companion and family dog.\n\nThe German longhaired pointer (GLP) is a breed of dog.  Developed in Germany, it is used as a multipurpose gundog.  It is closely related to its cousins, the German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP), the German Wirehaired Pointer (GWP) and the Large Münsterländer, which was previously part of the breed.\n\nBelgium is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically forced labor and forced prostitution.

Male victims are subjected to forced labor and exploitation in restaurants, bars, sweatshops, horticulture sites, fruit farms, construction sites, and retail shops.  There were reportedly seven Belgian women subjected to forced prostitution in Luxembourg in 2009.  According to a 2009 ECPAT Report, the majority of girls and children subjected to forced prostitution in Belgium originate from Eastern Europe and Nigeria; some young foreign boys are exploited in prostitution in major cities in the country.

The original motivation for having so many counties was to ensure that residents in the days of poor roads and horseback travel could make a round trip from their home to the county seat and back in a single day, as well as being able to travel from one county seat to the next in the same fashion.  Later, however, politics began to play a part, with citizens who disagreed with the present county government simply petitioning the state to create a new county.

It marks a highpoint of the late 15th century Ghent-Bruges school of illumination and is now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna (Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Codex Vindobonensis 1897).  It is thought to have been a wedding gift from James IV of Scotland or another Scottish nobleman to James's wife Margaret Tudor on the occasion of their marriage, perhaps finishing a book already started for another purpose.  A number of artists worked on the extensive programme of decoration, so that \"the manuscript in its entirety presents a rather odd picture of heterogeneity\".  The best known miniature, a full-page portrait of James at prayer before an altar with an altarpiece of Christ and an altar frontal with James's coat-of-arms, gave his name to the Master of James IV of Scotland, who is now generally identified as Gerard Horenbout, court painter to Margaret of Austria; he did only one other miniature in the book.  The equivalent image of Margaret is the only image by another artist, using a rather generic face for the queen's portrait, and in a similar style to that of the Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian.  Other artists worked on the other miniatures, which include an unusual series of unpopulated landscapes in the calendar - perhaps the Flemish artists were not sure how Scots should be dressed.\n\nArthur Tudor (20 September 1486 – 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall.  As the eldest son and heir apparent of Henry VII of England, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.  His mother, Elizabeth of York, was the daughter of Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York.\n\nMargaret Tudor (28 November 1489 – 18 October 1541) was Queen of Scots from 1503 until 1513 by marriage to James IV of Scotland and then, after her husband died fighting the English, she became regent for their son James V of Scotland.  She was born at Westminster Palace as the oldest daughter of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and granddaughter of Margaret Beaufort, Edward IV of England and Queen Elizabeth Woodville.  Margaret Tudor had several pregnancies, but most of her children died young or were stillborn.  As queen dowager she married Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus.  Through her first and second marriages, respectively, Margaret was the grandmother of both Mary, Queen of Scots, and Mary's second husband, Lord Darnley.  Margaret's marriage to James IV foreshadowed the Union of the Crowns – their great-grandson, James VI and I, was the first to be monarch of both Scotland and England.\n\nSir Hugh Conway was created Lord Treasurer of Ireland in 1494 by King Henry VII of England.  He replaced Sir James Ormonde as Lord Treasurer of Ireland.  In 1504 he was appointed Treasurer of Calais by Henry VII ( Cal.  Pat.  Rolls Henry VIII, vol.  ii, 365).  Hugh Conway was an early supporter of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (later Henry VII), was sent by Margaret Beaufort, Henry's mother to Henry, in exile in France, in 1483 with a large sum of money and encouragement to invade England through Wales and seize the crown from Richard III.  Henry did so in 1485 and Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth, where Hugh was present.  Hugh was appointed Keeper of the Great Wardrobe by King Henry VII on 21 September 1485, was knighted in January 1486 at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth of York, daughter of King Edward IV, and married Elizabeth Courtenay, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon, in 1490.  Sir Hugh Conway was appointed Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire by Henry VII in 1500.  Sir Hugh was a son of John ‘ Aer Conwy Hen ’ of Bodrhyddan Hall and Constable of Rhuddlan Castle, Flintshire, Wales, by his first marriage, and descended from the ancient line of Conway (Conwy = Wales) and de Crevecouer (The Journal Of The Flintshire Historical Society (Appendix D: Conwy Pedigree (British Museum Harleian MS 1971))).  Sir Hugh's younger half-brother was Edward Conway who married the heiress of Arrow and Alcester, Warwickshire, and was great-grandfather to Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway of Ragley Hall, ancestor of the present family of Seymour Conways, Marquis of Hertford.\n\nElizabeth Woodville (also spelled Wydville, Wydeville, or Widvile; c. 1437 – 8 June 1492) was Queen consort of England as the spouse of King Edward IV from 1464 until his death in 1483.  At the time of her birth, her family was mid-ranked in the English aristocracy.  Her first marriage was to a minor supporter of the House of Lancaster, Sir John Grey of Groby; he died at the Second Battle of St Albans, leaving Elizabeth a widowed mother of two sons.  Her second marriage, to Edward IV, was a cause célèbre of the day, thanks to Elizabeth's great beauty and lack of great estates.  Edward was only the second king of England since the Norman Conquest to have married one of his subjects, and Elizabeth was the first such consort to be crowned queen.  Her marriage greatly enriched her siblings and children, but their advancement incurred the hostility of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, 'The Kingmaker', and his various alliances with the most senior figures in the increasingly divided royal family.\n\nCatherine or Katherine of York (14 August 1479 – 15 November 1527) was the ninth child and sixth daughter of King Edward IV by his wife Elizabeth Woodville.  From birth to death, she was daughter to Edward IV, sister to Edward V, niece to Richard III, sister-in-law to Henry VII and aunt to Henry VIII.\n\nHenry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven (c. 1495 – 1552) was Master of the Scottish Artillery and last husband of Margaret Tudor, eldest daughter of Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York.\n\nElizabeth of York (11 February 1466 – 11 February 1503) was queen consort of England from 1486 until her death.  As the wife of Henry VII, she was the first Tudor queen.  She was the daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III, and she married the king following Henry's victory at the Battle of Bosworth which started the last phase of the Wars of the Roses.  She was the mother of King Henry VIII.  Therefore, she was the daughter, sister, niece, wife, mother, and grandmother of successive kings and queens of England.\n\nAlice Holland, Countess of Kent (c. 1350 – 17 March 1416), LG, formerly Lady Alice FitzAlan, was an English noblewoman, a daughter of the 10th Earl of Arundel, and the wife of the 2nd Earl of Kent, the half-brother of King Richard II.  As the maternal grandmother of Anne Mortimer, she was an ancestor of King Edward IV and King Richard III, as well as King Henry VII and the Tudor dynasty through her daughter Margaret Holland.  She was also the maternal grandmother of Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scotland.", "id": "hotpotqa_86"}
{"question": "Hera is the goddess of women and marriage in Greek mythology and what collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices?", "golden_answers": ["Ancient Greek religion"], "context": "Etruscan mythology comprises a set of stories, beliefs, and religious practices of the Etruscan civilization, originating in the 7th century BC from the preceding Iron Age Villanovan culture, with its influences in the mythology of ancient Greece and Phoenicia, and sharing similarities with concurrent Roman mythology.  As the Etruscan civilization was assimilated into the Roman Republic in the 4th century BC, the Etruscan religion and mythology were partially incorporated into classical Roman culture, following the Roman tendency to absorb some of the local gods and customs of conquered lands.\n\nGreek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.  It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece.  Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.\n\nIn ancient Roman religion and myth, Nerio was an ancient war goddess and the personification of valor.  She was the partner of Mars in ancient cult practices, and was sometimes identified with the goddess Bellona, and occasionally with the goddess Minerva.  Spoils taken from enemies were sometimes dedicated to Nerio by the Romans.  Nerio was later supplanted by mythologized deities appropriated and adapted from other religions.\n\nThe Theoi Project (also known as Theoi Greek Mythology) is a digital library website about Greek mythology and its representation in classical literature and ancient Greek art.  It serves as a free reference to the gods (\"theoi\"), spirits (\"daimones\"), mythological creatures (\"theres\") and heroes of ancient Greek mythology and religion.  Established in 2000, the website contains over 9,000 pages and 9,000 images.  The website also has a library of classical literature on the theme of Greek mythology, including the works of many of the lesser-known poets.\n\nThe religious element is difficult to identify in Mycenaean Greece (c. 1600-1100 BC), especially as regards archaeological sites, where it remains problematic to pick out a place of worship with certainty.  John Chadwick points out that at least six centuries lie between the earliest presence of Proto-Greek speakers in Hellas and the earliest inscriptions in the Mycenaean script known as Linear B, during which concepts and practices will have fused with indigenous beliefs, and—if cultural influences in material culture reflect influences in religious beliefs—with Minoan religion.  As for these texts, the few lists of offerings that give names of gods as recipients of goods reveal nothing about religious practices, and there is no surviving literature.  John Chadwick rejected a confusion of Minoan and Mycenaean religion derived from archaeological correlations and cautioned against \"the attempt to uncover the prehistory of classical Greek religion by conjecturing its origins and guessing the meaning of its myths\" above all through treacherous etymologies.  Moses I. Finley detected very few authentic Mycenaean reflections in the eighth-century Homeric world, in spite of its \"Mycenaean\" setting.  However, Nilsson asserts, based not on uncertain etymologies but on religious elements and on the representations and general function of the gods, that a lot of Minoan gods and religious conceptions were fused in the Mycenaean religion.  From the existing evidence, it appears that the Mycenaean religion was the mother of the Greek religion.  The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that can be found in classical Greece.\n\nThe Heraion of Argos (Greek: Ἡραῖον Ἄργους ) is an ancient temple in Argos, Greece.  It was part of the greatest sanctuary in the Argolid, dedicated to Hera, whose epithet \"Argive Hera\" (Ἥρη Ἀργείη \"Here Argeie\") appears in Homer's works.  Hera herself claims to be the protector of Argos in \"Iliad\" IV, 50–52): \"The three towns I love best are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets\".  The memory was preserved at Argos of an archaic, aniconic pillar representation of the Great Goddess.  The site, which might mark the introduction of the cult of Hera in mainland Greece, lies northeast of Argos between the archaeological sites of Mycenae and Midea, two important Mycenaean cities.  The traveller Pausanias, visiting the site in the 2nd century CE, referred to the area as Prosymna (Προσύμνη).\n\nIn ancient Greek religion, Kanathos (Greek: Κάναθος ) in the Argolid was the spring at Nauplia, where Hera annually renewed her virginity.  There, Pausanias noted, was \"a spring called Kanathos where, so say the Argives, Hera bathes every year and, by so doing, becomes a maiden; it is this story which is of the secrets connected with the rites which they perform to Hera.\"  The unspoken nature of the ritual forbade its being embodied openly or directly in Greek mythology.  S. Casson suggested that it was the obscure subject of the so-called \"Ludovisi Throne\", generally considered to represent the parallel, and far better-known, renewal of Aphrodite, bathing in the sea at Paphos.\n\nAncient Greek religion encompasses the collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology originating in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices.  These groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or \"cults\" in the plural, though most of them shared similarities.\n\nHera ( , ; Greek: Ἥρᾱ \"Hērā\", equivalently Ἥρη \"Hērē\", in Ionic and Homer) is the goddess of women and marriage in Greek mythology and religion.  She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea.  Hera is married to her brother Zeus and is titled as the Queen of Heaven.  One of her characteristics is her jealous and vengeful nature against Zeus's other lovers and offspring and against the mortals who cross her.\n\nA xoanon ( , Greek: ξόανον ; plural: ξόανα \"xoana\", from the verb ξέειν, \"xeein\", to carve or scrape [wood]) was an Archaic wooden cult image of Ancient Greece.  Classical Greeks associated such cult objects, whether aniconic or effigy, with the legendary Daedalus.  Many such cult images were preserved into historical times, though none are known to have survived to the modern day, except where their image was copied in stone or marble.  In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias described numerous xoana in his \"Description of Greece\", notably the image of Hera in her temple at Samos.  \"The statue of Samian Hera, as Aethilos [sic!]  says, was a wooden beam at first, but afterwards, when Prokles was ruler, it was humanized in form\".  In Pausanias' travels he never mentions seeing a xoanon of a mortal man.", "id": "hotpotqa_87"}

Whether one thinks of the athletic contests portrayed in Greek vase painting and sculpture, the epic hunts that form the subjects of so many great medieval tapestries and manuscript pages, or the elegant horse-racing scenes of Fay Moore and Marilyn Newmark, depicting sport has inspired artists particularly those who want to capture the motion and emotion of sport.  In America, a country celebrated for hard work and hard play, sport art has had an especially vigorous history.  Many of the most renowned artists- Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, and George Bellows-were active sports persons themselves and numbered among their friends leading athletes, fishermen and hunters.

{"question": "Vanished Planet and Medici, are which type of entertainment?", "golden_answers": ["board game"], "context": "HD 46375 b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 109 light-years away in the constellation of Monoceros, orbiting the star HD 46375.  With 79 Ceti b on March 29, 2000, it was joint first known extrasolar planet less massive than Saturn orbiting a normal star.  The planet is a \"hot Jupiter\", a type of planet that orbits very close to its parent star.  In this case the orbital distance is only a tenth that of the planet Mercury.  No transit of the planet has been detected, so its inclination must be less than 83°.  Because the inclination is unknown, the true mass of the planet is not known.\n\nThe Capitoline Venus is a type of statue of Venus, specifically one of several \"Venus Pudica\" (modest Venus) types (others include the Venus de' Medici type), of which several examples exist.  The type ultimately derives from the Aphrodite of Cnidus.  The Capitoline Venus and her variants are recognisable from the position of the arms—standing after a bath, Venus begins to cover her breasts with her right hand, and her groin with her left hand.\n\nMedici is a German-style board game by Reiner Knizia.  Players buy cards in an auction and match in series and in sets to end up with most points from those formations.\n\nVanished Planet is a cooperative board game that debuted at the World Boardgaming Championships in 2003.  \"Vanished Planet\" pits the players against a time limit; the players must succeed in a certain number of goals before this time limit is reached, or they all lose.\n\nThe Venus de' Medici or Medici Venus is a Hellenistic marble sculpture depicting the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite.  It is a 1st-century BCE marble copy, perhaps made in Athens, of a bronze original Greek sculpture, following the type of the Aphrodite of Knidos, which would have been made by a sculptor in the immediate Praxitelean tradition, perhaps at the end of the century.  It has become one of the navigation points by which the progress of the Western classical tradition is traced, the references to it outline the changes of taste and the process of classical scholarship.  It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy.\n\nA lava planet is a hypothetical type of terrestrial planet, with a surface mostly or entirely covered by molten lava.  Situations where such planets could exist include a young terrestrial planet just after its formation, a planet that has recently suffered a large collision event, or a planet orbiting very close to its star, causing intense irradiation and tidal forces.\n\nThe Barberini Venus, Jenkins Venus or Weddell Venus, is a copy from the Aphrodite of Cnidus, along the lines of the Venus de Medici.  Its torso is a Hadrianic copy in Parian marble of the same type as the Venus de' Medici, with 18th-century restorations.\n\nBallet is a formalized form of dance with its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th and 16th centuries.  Ballet spread from Italy to France with the help of Catherine de' Medici, where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence.  An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, Marguerite de Valois to Henry of Navarre.  Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.  The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'.  In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the Polish ambassadors who were visiting Paris upon the accession of Henry of Anjou to the throne of Poland.  In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\", however it was her compatriot, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, who organized the ballet.  Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline.  Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.\n\nAn eyeball planet is a hypothetical type of tidally locked planet, for which tidal locking induces spatial features (for example in the geography or composition of the planet) resembling an eyeball.  It is mainly used for terrestrial planets where liquid may be present, in which tidal locking will induce a spatially dependent temperature gradient (the planet will be very hot on the side facing the star and very cold on the other side).  This temperature gradient will therefore limit the places in which liquid may exist on the surface of the planet to ring or disk shaped areas.\n\nThe Colossal Baroque style is a name which has been coined to describe a number of compositions from the 17th and 18th centuries composed in an opulent, magnificent and large-scaled style.  Such works frequently make use of polychoral techniques and often feature instrumental forces considerably larger than the norm for the Baroque period.  The Colossal Baroque had its roots in Italy, in the resplendent multiple polychoral music of the Venetian School, in the sumptuous, extravagant productions of the Medici court, for example the 40- and 60-voice \"Missa sopra Ecco sì beato giorno\" by Alessandro Striggio, and in the large polychoral works of the Roman School, many of which were written long after the Venetian School had vanished.  An impetus for this music was the Council of Trent [Counter-Reformation].  Some attendees of the Council held the unofficial point of view that music should be subservient to text, as both exemplified as well as idealized in the choral music of Palestrina.  Some critics held that this was not as achievable in larger choral textures.", "id": "hotpotqa_105"}

It involves a dialectical and materialist, or dialectical materialist, approach to the application of Marxism to the cultural sphere, specifically areas related to taste such as art, beauty, etc.  Marxists believe that economic and social conditions, and especially the class relations that derive from them, affect every aspect of an individual's life, from religious beliefs to legal systems to cultural frameworks.  From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics.  For instance, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, who greatly influenced the art of the early Soviet Union, followed the secular humanism of Ludwig Feuerbach more than he followed Marx.\n\nThe first Korean student movement begun in 1919, when students took part in the Sam-il Movement of 1 March to call for the end of Japanese colonization.  The student movement has since then played a major part in several big political changes in Korea.  Before liberation of Korea from Japanese rule in 1945, the main focus of the student movement was opposing this rule and demanding Korea's independence.  After 1945, the student movement was mainly concerned with righting the wrongs in Korean government.  Students rose for instance against the South Korea's government of Syngman Rhee after the rigged elections in March 1960.  1980 marked a turning point in the South Korean student movement.  After the Gwangju massacre in May 1980, the student movement got a clear vision, partly based on Marxism, and had a pivotal role in the democratization of South Korean society.  Student activism is still common on the 21st century South Korean political scene.\n\nMarxism is a form of socioeconomic analysis that explores class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation – it originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\n\nMarxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict, that uses a materialist interpretation of historical development, and a dialectical view of social transformation.  Marxist methodology uses economic and sociopolitical inquiry and applies that to the critique and analysis of the development of capitalism and the role of class struggle in systemic economic change.\n\nCapital.  Volume I: The Process of Production of Capital (German: \"Das Kapital.  Erster Band.  Buch I: Der Produktionsprocess des Kapitals\" ) is an 1867 economics book by German philosopher Karl Marx.  In this, the only part of Marx's multi-volume \"\" to be published during his lifetime, Marx critiques capitalism chiefly from the standpoint of its production processes.  After Marx's death, Friedrich Engels compiled and expanded his friend's notes into volumes \"II\" (1885) and \"III\" (1894).\n\nThe Gwangju Student Independence Movement (Hangul: 광주 학생 독립 운동 Hanja:光州學生獨立運動), or Gwangju Student Movement was a Korean independence movement in Gwangju against the 22 August 1910 to 15 August 1945 Japanese rule of Korea.  The Gwangju Student Independence Movement took place in October and November 1929.  It is considered the second-most important Korean independence movement in the period of the Japanese occupation, with the March 1st Movement considered the most important.  The Gwangju Student Independence Movement spread out throughout the Korean Peninsula.\n\nVarious Marxist authors have focused on Marx's method of analysis and presentation (historical materialist and logically dialectical) as key factors both in understanding the range and incisiveness of Karl Marx's theoretical writing in general and \"Das Kapital \" in particular.  One of the clearest and most instructive examples of this is his discussion of \"the value-form\", which acts as a primary guide or key to understanding the logical argument as it develops throughout the volumes of \"Das Kapital \".\n\nConflict theories are perspectives in sociology and social psychology that emphasize a materialist interpretation of history, dialectical method of analysis, a critical stance toward existing social arrangements, and political program of revolution or, at least, reform.  Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies.  It is therefore a macro level analysis of society.  Karl Marx is the father of the social conflict theory, which is a component of the four paradigms of sociology.  Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought.  While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory \"does not\" refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict.\n\nK. Ramakrishna Pillai (1878–1916) was a nationalist writer, journalist, editor, and political activist.  He edited \"Swadeshabhimani\" (The Patriot), the newspaper which became a potent weapon against the rule of the British and the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (Kerala, India) and a tool for social transformation.  His criticism of the Diwan of Travancore, P. Rajagopalachari and the Maharajah led to the eventual confiscation of the newspaper.  Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and exiled from Travancore in 1910.  Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam (1912) and Karl Marx (1912) are among his most noted works in Malayalam, Vrithantha Pathra pravarthanam being the first book on journalism in Malayalam and Karl Marx, the first ever biography of Karl Marx in any Indian language.", "id": "hotpotqa_108"}

The pass is located on and traverses the continental divide at the crest of the Front Range southwest of Boulder, and is at the boundaries of Grand, Gilpin, and Boulder counties.  The pass provides a route over the Continental Divide between the Atlantic Ocean watershed of South Boulder Creek (in the basin of the South Platte River) with the Pacific Ocean watershed of the Fraser River, a tributary of the Colorado River.\n\nMilner Pass, elevation 10759 ft is a mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of northern Colorado in the United States.  It is located on the continental divide in the Front Range, within Rocky Mountain National Park, along the boundary between Larimer and Grand counties.  The pass provides the passage over the continental divide for US 34, also known as Trail Ridge Road between Estes Park and Grand Lake.  The pass is not, however, the high point on Trail Ridge Road, which crests at 12183 ft east of the pass within Rocky Mountain National Park.  Along with the rest of Trail Ridge Road, the pass is generally closed in winter from the first heavy snow fall (usually October) until the opening of the road around Memorial Day.  The gentle pass divides the headwaters of the Cache la Poudre River (which issues from Poudre Lake just east of the pass) and several creeks near the headwaters of the Colorado River to the west.  The road near the pass provides a panoramic view of the Never Summer Mountains to the west.\n\nMacDonald Pass, el.6312 ft , (also known as McDonald Pass) is a mountain pass on the continental divide west of Helena, Montana that is traversed by U.S. Route 12.  The pass is one of three passes (MacDonald, Mullan and Priest) used in the 1870s-80s for travel between Helena and Deer Lodge, Montana over the continental divide.\n\nThe Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (in short Continental Divide Trail (CDT)) is a United States National Scenic Trail running 3,100 miles between Mexico and Canada.  It follows the Continental Divide of the Americas along the Rocky Mountains and traverses five U.S. states — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.  In Montana it crosses Triple Divide Pass (near Triple Divide Peak which separates the Hudson Bay, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean drainages.) The trail is a combination of dedicated trails and small roads and considered 70% complete.  Portions designated as uncompleted must be traveled by roadwalking on dirt or paved roads.  This trail can be continued north into Canada to Kakwa Lake north of Jasper National Park by the Great Divide Trail, which is so far described only in a few books and carries no official Canadian status.\n\nMullan Pass is a mountain pass in the western United States, in the Rocky Mountains of Montana.  It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Powell and Lewis and Clark counties at 5902 ft above sea level.  In the Helena National Forest, the pass is\n\nLewis and Clark Pass, el.  6424 ft is a mountain pass on the continental divide in Montana.  It lies at the head of the drainages of the west flowing Blackfoot River and the east flowing Dearborn River.  The pass is in the Helena National Forest in Lewis and Clark County.  The Continental Divide Trail traverses north and south through the pass.  At the time of the Lewis and Clark Expedition the pass was a much-used pathway where the native people living in what today is Montana crossed over the continental divide.  The pass was crossed by Meriwether Lewis on July 7, 1806, on the return leg of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a party of nine men and his dog Seaman.  The pass was named for the expedition's two leaders–Lewis and William Clark.  Lewis and Clark Pass is the only roadless pass on the entire Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.  It has gone from being one of the most used continental divide passes prior to the pioneer era to one of the least visited passes today.  It can be accessed by a 1.5 mi trail.  Visitors will encounter the pass much as Lewis did in 1806.  The furrows left by the countless dog and horse travois that crossed the pass are still visible (though fading) and this is one of the places along the expedition's route that visitors may still encounter a grizzly bear.  On a clear day, like Meriwether Lewis in 1806 one can see Square Butte in Cascade County, Montana, 40 mi to the northeast.\n\nSpring Creek Pass, elevation 10889 ft , is a mountain pass on the Continental Divide in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado.  The pass is traversed by State Highway 149 and the Colorado Trail.  Somewhat unusually for a pass on the Continental Divide, it is not the highest point on the highway in the vicinity; heading north from the pass, the road climbs over the considerably higher Slumgullion Summit before descending toward Lake City.\n\nHomestake Pass is a mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the United States.  It sits on the Continental Divide on the border between Jefferson County and Silver Bow County, six miles south-southeast of Butte in Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest at an elevation of 6329 ft .\n\nInterstate 90 (I-90) is a transcontinental freeway, and the longest Interstate Highway in the United States at 3,020.54 mi .  Its western terminus is in Seattle, at State Route 519 near Safeco Field and CenturyLink Field, and its eastern terminus is in Boston, at Route 1A near Logan International Airport.  I-90 crosses the Continental Divide over Homestake Pass just east of Butte, Montana.  East of the Wisconsin-Illinois border, much of I-90 follows several toll roads, many of which predate the Interstate Highway system.  The Jane Addams Memorial Tollway, Chicago Skyway, Indiana Toll Road, Ohio Turnpike, New York State Thruway, Massachusetts Turnpike, and the Ted Williams Tunnel are all toll roads used by I-90 in the eastern half of the country.  The Interstate is not tolled through some segments in downtown Chicago; Greater Cleveland, and the rest of Northeast Ohio; Pennsylvania; and through brief sections near Buffalo and Albany.  Erie, Pennsylvania; Madison, Wisconsin; Billings, Montana; and Spokane, Washington are other major cities on I-90.\n\nElk Park Pass, elevation 6352 ft , is a mountain pass on the Continental Divide in southwestern Montana, about 4 mi northeast of Butte.  It is traversed by Interstate 15 and is one of three crossings of the Divide by the Interstate (all in Montana), the others being Monida Pass (on the border with Idaho) and Deer Lodge Pass southwest of Butte.  Elk Park Pass lies on the border between Silver Bow and Jefferson counties and is remarkable for its highly asymmetrical nature.  The approach from the north is through namesake Elk Park, a high, mostly treeless plain (like South Park in Colorado or the Sierra Valley in California), and the grade is almost imperceptible.  The elevation at the northeast end of the park, about 10 mi from the pass, is about 6200 ft , only 152 ft lower than the pass itself.  However, at the south end, the highway drops 750 ft from the pass into Butte over a distance of only about 4 mi .", "id": "hotpotqa_109"}

The office has a largely ceremonial (figurehead) role, but may also veto legislation or send legislation to the Constitutional Court for review.  Most other executive powers, such as selecting Government ministers and leading legislative initiatives, are vested in the office of the Prime Minister instead.\n\nThe Executive Council of Upper Canada had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly.  Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the Legislative Assembly but were usually members of the Legislative Council.  Members were appointed, often for life.  The first five members were appointed in July 1792.  The Council was dissolved on 10 February 1841 when Upper Canada and Lower Canada were united into the Province of Canada.  It was replaced by the Executive Council of the Province of Canada the same year.\n\nThe New South Wales Legislative Council, or upper house, is one of the two chambers of the parliament of the Australian state of New South Wales.  The other is the Legislative Assembly.  Both sit at Parliament House in the state capital, Sydney.  The Assembly is referred to as the lower house and the Council as the upper house.  It is normal for legislation to be first deliberated on and enacted in the lower house, and then considered in the upper house, which acts in the main as a house of review.  The Council has 42 members, elected by proportional representation in which the whole state is treated as a single electorate.  Members serve eight-year terms, which are staggered so that half the Council is up for election every four years—roughly coinciding with elections to the Legislative Assembly.\n\n\" It was the elected part of the legislature for the province of Upper Canada, functioning as the lower house in the Parliament of Upper Canada.

The Mahafzah were relied upon to help aid a wing of the Muslim armies.  Several members of the Mahaftha tribe left the small town of Kufr Jayiz in search of education and a better life.  Today some Mahaftha tribe members reside in Irbid, Amman, Karak, England, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the United States of America, the census of mahfzah members around 3000, Mahafzah tribe has common council in Kufr Jayiz called Mazafah, they meet there in social occasions.\n\nIn the Irish Free State, an extern minister, formally a Minister who shall not be a Member of the Executive Council, was a minister who had charge of a department but was not a member of the Executive Council.  Extern ministers were individually nominated by Dáil Éireann (the lower house), whereas of the Executive Council only the President was: he in turn nominated the other members.  All ministers were formally appointed by the Governor-General.  The Executive Council included the senior ministers, exercised cabinet collective responsibility, and had to be TDs (members of the Dáil); the extern ministers filled more junior technocratic roles, and need not be legislators, though in fact all were TDs.

It was the more powerful of the two chambers; it alone had the power to initiate legislation (the Senate, by contrast, could amend or veto most legislation, but could not initiate it).  The House of Representatives also had much greater jurisdiction over financial bills; the Senate could not amend them, although it might veto them.  Except in the case of amendments to the Constitution, over which a veto of the Senate was absolute, the House of Representatives might override a Senatorial veto by passing the same bill a second time, in the parliamentary session immediately following the one in which it was rejected by the Senate, after a minimum period of six months.\n\nA veto – Latin for \"I forbid\" – is the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation.  A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the United Nations Security Council, whose permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States of America) can block any resolution, or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate may override a Presidential veto of legislation.  A veto may give power only to stop changes (thus allowing its holder to protect the status quo), like the US legislative veto mentioned before, or to also adopt them (an \"amendatory veto\"), like the legislative veto of the Indian President, which allows him to propose amendments to bills returned to the Parliament for reconsideration.", "id": "hotpotqa_115"}

{"question": "What was the name of the hill that was the seat of an estate uphill Aldbury?", "golden_answers": ["Chiltern Hills"], "context": "The Richmond Hill Inn was a 25-room Inn located on the Historic Richmond Hill estate in North Carolina.  It was a Queen Anne style mansion that was built in 1889 and has now been gutted by the arson fire.  It served as the private residence of ambassador and congressman Richmond Pearson.  Its name derives from a combination of its builder, Richmond Pearson, and the designer, James G. Hill.  At the time of its construction, the mansion was one of the most elegant structures in Asheville, with running water, ten fireplaces, and a pulley-operated baggage elevator.  It served as a center for social and political activity for many years during Pearson's life.  The Estate is located on French Broad River, surrounded by rolling grounds with gardens.\n\nPark Hill is a council housing estate in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.  It was built between 1957 and 1961, and in 1998 was given Grade II* listed building status.  Following a period of decline, the estate is being renovated by developers Urban Splash.  The renovation was one of the six short-listed projects for the 2013 RIBA Stirling Prize.  The Estate falls within the Manor Castle ward of the City.  Park Hill is also the name of the area in which the flats are sited.  The name relates to the deer park attached to Sheffield Manor, the remnant of which is now known as Norfolk Park.\n\nKillochan railway station was located in a rural part of South Ayrshire, Scotland and mainly served the nearby Killochan Castle estate.  The Killochan bank is the name given to this section of the line, running from Girvan on an uphill gradient to just north of the old station site.  Maybole is around nine miles away and Girvan two miles.\n\nThe Hundred of Redhill is a cadastral unit of hundred located in the Mid North of South Australia spanning the northern Barunga Range.

After one year, the band relocated to New York City and were signed to Atlantic Records within five months.  One of their first New York shows was opening up for the British band Dogs D'Amour and Mother Love Bone (featuring Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard who would form Pearl Jam after the death of lead singer Andrew Wood).  Their self-titled debut was recorded in London in the autumn of 1989 by David Bowie and T.Rex producer Tony Visconti and released in February 1990.  They were reviewed favorably as a cross between The Replacements and Hanoi Rocks.  The band cited their musical influences including KISS, The Ramones, The Replacements, Rick Springfield and George Jones and toured with New Jersey rockers Danger Danger, former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley and Phoenix rockers Icon (band).  The band let their contract with Atlantic expire in 1991 due to poor promotion on the part of the label.\n\n\"Jimmy\" is a song recorded by British artist M.I.A. for her second studio album, \"Kala\" (2007).

The Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created.  The discovery of the belts is credited to James Van Allen, and as a result the Earth's belts are known as the Van Allen belts.  Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 500 to 58,000 kilometers above the surface in which region radiation levels vary.  Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the Earth's atmosphere from destruction.\n\nElectron precipitation (also called energetic electron precipitation or EEP) is an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs when previously trapped electrons enter the Earth's atmosphere, thus creating communications interferences and other disturbances.  Electrons are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt by Earth's magnetic fields and begin to spiral around field lines in the radiation belt.  They may remain there for an indefinite period of time (in some cases years).  When broadband very low frequency (VLF) waves propagate the radiation belts, the electrons exit the radiation belt and \"precipitate\" (or travel) into the ionosphere (a region of Earth's atmosphere) where the electrons will collide with ions.  Electron precipitation is regularly linked to ozone depletion.  It is often caused by lightning strikes.\n\nGas-discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources that generate light by sending an electric discharge through an ionized gas, a plasma.  Typically, such lamps use a noble gas (argon, neon, krypton, and xenon) or a mixture of these gases.  Some include additional substances, like mercury, sodium, and metal halides, which are vaporized during startup to become part of the gas mixture.  In operation, some of the electrons are forced to leave the atoms of the gas near the anode by the electric field applied between the two electrodes, leaving these atoms positively ionized.  The electrons ejected from these atoms flow onto the anode, while the cations thus formed are accelerated by the electric field and flow towards the cathode.  Typically, after traveling a very short distance, the ions collide with neutral gas atoms, which transfer their electrons to the ions.  The atoms, having lost an electron during the collisions, ionize and speed toward the cathode while the ions, having gained an electron during the collisions, return to a lower energy state while releasing energy in the form of photons.  Light of a characteristic frequency is thus emitted.  In this way, electrons are relayed through the gas from the anode to the cathode.  The color of the light produced depends on the emission spectra of the atoms making up the gas, as well as the pressure of the gas, current density, and other variables.  Gas discharge lamps can produce a wide range of colors.  Some lamps produce ultraviolet radiation which is converted to visible light by a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp's glass surface.  The fluorescent lamp is perhaps the best known gas-discharge lamp.\n\nInterbol (Russian: Интербол ) is an international space project under the leadership of the Russian Space Agency and the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The list of participants includes the Institute of Atmospheric Research of the Czech Academy of Sciences, NASA, European Space Agency, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency.  The goal of the project is to study the correlations between plasma processes in the tail of the magnetosphere and in the Van Allen radiation belt (auroral particles acceleration region) with a high time-space resolution.  Two space probes have been launched into high-altitude elliptical orbits:\n\nPlasma (from Ancient Greek πλάσμα , meaning \"moldable substance\" or \"jelly\") can simply be considered as a gaseous mixture of negatively charged electrons and highly charged positive ions, however, true plasma production is from the distinct separation of these ions and electrons that produces an electric field, which in turn, produces electric currents and magnetic fields. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter and was first introduced by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.  Unlike, the other three states of solid, liquid, and gas, plasma does not freely exist on the Earth.  Plasma can be generated by heating neutral gases or by subjecting gas to a strong electromagnetic field.\n\nIonic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds.  The ions are atoms that have gained one or more electrons (known as anions, which are negatively charged) and atoms that have lost one or more electrons (known as cations, which are positively charged).  This transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to covalence.  In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH or SO.  In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal in order to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.\n\nA Birkeland current is a set of currents that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth’s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere.  In the Earth’s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment).  The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms).  Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Auroras Borealis and Australis.  In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere.  The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets.  One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector.  The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector.  The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone is referred to as the Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.\n\nElectrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions.  Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field.  Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law.  Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated.  Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields.  Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space.  Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.\n\nAn astrophysical plasma is a plasma (a highly ionized gas) whose physical properties are studied as part of astrophysics.  Much of the baryonic matter of the universe is thought to consist of plasma, a state of matter in which atoms and molecules are so hot, that they have ionized by breaking up into their constituent parts, negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. Because the particles are charged, they are strongly influenced by electromagnetic forces, that is, by magnetic and electric fields.  All astrophysical plasmas are likely influenced by magnetic fields.\n\nIn plasma physics, waves in plasmas are an interconnected set of particles and fields which propagates in a periodically repeating fashion.  A plasma is a quasineutral, electrically conductive fluid.  In the simplest case, it is composed of electrons and a single species of positive ions, but it may also contain multiple ion species including negative ions as well as neutral particles.  Due to its electrical conductivity, a plasma couples to electric and magnetic fields.  This complex of particles and fields supports a wide variety of wave phenomena.", "id": "hotpotqa_123"}

The grape is also used for up to 10% of the blend for the Ruché-based Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato DOC.\n\nAsti (also known as Asti Spumante) is a sparkling white Italian wine that is produced throughout southeastern Piedmont but is particularly focused around the towns of Asti and Alba.  Since 1993 the wine has been classified as a \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) and as of 2004 was Italy's largest producing appellation.  In fact, on an average vintage more than ten times as much Asti is produced in Piedmont than the more well-known Piedmontese red wine Barolo.\n\nGrignolino (] ) is a red Italian wine grape variety commonly grown in the Piedmont region.  It makes light colored wines and rosés with very fruity aromas, strong acidity and tannins.  The name Grignolino derives from the word \"grignole\" which means \"many pips\" in the local Piedmontese dialect of the Asti region.  The abundance of pips, or seeds, contribute to the strong, bitter tannins associated with the wine.  Modern winemaker try to avoid the excess tannins with gentle and slow pressings.  Grignolino has two \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOCs) that produce wine from it - Asti and Monferrato Casale.\n\nFreisa is a red Italian wine grape variety grown in the Piedmont region of north-west Italy, primarily in Monferrato and in the Langhe, but also further north in the provinces of Turin and Biella.  Freisa is a vigorous and productive vine whose round, blue-black grapes are harvested in early October.  The three-lobed leaves are relatively small and the bunches are elongated in form.  By the 1880s it had become one of the major Piedmontese grapes, and in that period its cultivation was stimulated by the vine’s resistance to the downy mildew caused by the Plasmopara viticola fungus.  Wines made from the Freisa grape are red and usually somewhat sweet and lightly sparkling, or foaming.  Still and fully sparkling versions are also produced, however, as are dry and more decidedly sweet styles.  In the Canavese there is also a rosé which can be made primarily from Freisa according to \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) regulations.\n\nGreco is an Italian wine grape that may be of Greek origin.  The name relates to both white \"(Greco bianco)\" and black \"(Greco nero)\" wine grape varieties.  While there is more land area dedicated to \"Greco nero\", the \"Greco bianco\" is the grape most commonly referred to by \"Greco\".  In the Campania region it is used to produce the \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) wine \"Greco di Tufo\".  In Calabria, it is used to make the \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata\" (DOC) wine \"Greco di Bianco\".  The name \"Greco\" is sometimes used as a synonym for several varieties of supposed Greek origins-most notably Trebbiano.\n\nRuché (pronounced in English , ] ) is a red Italian wine grape variety from the Piedmont region.  It is largely used in making Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato, a small production red varietal wine which was granted \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata\" (DOC) status by presidential decree on October 22, 1987, and was granted the more prestigious \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) status in 2010.  The current DOC recognized area of production for the wine, covers only about 100 acres (40 hectares) of vines around the villages of Castagnole Monferrato, Refrancore, Grana, Montemagno, Viarigi, Scurzolengo and Portacomaro.  Ruché di Castagnole Monferrato is, therefore, one of the lowest production varietal wines in Italy.  The grape is also grown to some extent in the neighboring province of Alessandria.\n\nMontepulciano ] is a red Italian wine grape variety that is most noted for being the primary grape behind the \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) wine Offida Rosso, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane (as well its larger DOC outside of Colline Teramane), Rosso Conero and the \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) wines Rosso Piceno Superiore.\n\nCortese is a white Italian wine grape variety predominantly grown in the southeastern regions of Piedmont in the provinces of Alessandria and Asti.  It is the primary grape of the \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) wines of Cortese dell'Alto Monferrato and Colli Tortonesi as well as the \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) wine of Cortese di Gavi.  Significant plantings of Cortese can also be found in the Lombardy region of Oltrepò Pavese and in the DOC white blends of the Veneto wine region of Bianco di Custoza.  Cortese has a long history in Italian viticulture with written documentation naming the grape among the plantings in a Piedmontese vineyard as early as 1659.  The grape's moderate acidity and light flavors has made it a favorite for the restaurants in nearby Genoa as a wine pairing with the local seafood caught off the Ligurian coast.\n\nBrachetto d'Acqui ] is a red Italian wine that is classified as a \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita\" (DOCG) since 1996 and previously a \"Denominazione di Origine Controllata\" (DOC) region since 1969.  It is produced in the Piedmont wine region around Acqui Terme in the province of Alessandria with some overlap into the province of Asti.  The wine is produced from the Brachetto grape, a variety that is believed to be native to Piedmont, and can be still or sparkling with usually some sweetness.", "id": "hotpotqa_124"}
{"question": "The city that Šuazeliai Palace is in is composed of how many quarters?", "golden_answers": ["74 quarters"], "context": "The City Cemetery of Raleigh, also known as Old City Cemetery, was authorized in 1798 by the North Carolina General Assembly as Raleigh's first burying ground.  It was laid out on 4 acre of land just outside the original 1792 eastern boundary of Raleigh and bounded by East Street on the west, East Hargett Street on the south, and Morgan Street on the north.  It was originally laid out in four equal quarters with the northern two quarters reserved for residents, the southwestern for visitors, and the southeastern for Negroes, both free and slaves.  Over time, the cemetery has gradually been enlarged toward New Bern Street in 1819, 1849, and 1856 and now contains approximately 7.5 acre .  The cemetery was enclosed in 1898 by a cast-iron fence that was formerly around Union Square to keep straying livestock out of the State Capitol grounds.  A network of cobblestone driveways with granite curbstones run though the cemetery.  In 1857, the city boundaries were extended to include the cemetery, and the city charter provided for a resident caretaker.  Many persons of Raleigh's and North Carolina's early period are interred at City Cemetery including governors, mayors, politicians, newspaper editors, military officers, ministers, doctors, planters, attorneys, bankers, and Scottish and English stonemasons who helped build the Capitol.\n\nHeinrich von Bülow also known as Big Top (Grotekop) was a knight born in the middle of the fourteenth century.  He died either before 1395 or during 1415.  He prospered as a warrior-supporter of Prince Albrecht of Mecklenburg (and of Sweden).  Outside Mecklenberg, Heinrich Grotekop is still remembered in many quarters as an archetypal robber baron on account of his appetite for feuding.\n\nSpain in the 19th century was a country in turmoil.  Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a massively destructive \"war of independence\" ensued, driven by an emergent Spanish nationalism.  An era of reaction against the liberal ideas associated with revolutionary France followed the war, personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII and – to a lesser extent – his daughter Isabella II.  Ferdinand's rule included the loss of the Spanish colonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s.  A series of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans against conservatives, culminating in the Carlist Wars between the moderate Queen Isabella and her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos.  Disaffection with Isabella's government from many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several revolutionary attempts against the government.  Two of these revolutions were successful, the moderate Vicalvarada or \"Vicálvaro Revolution\" of 1854 and the more radical \"la Gloriosa\" (Glorious Revolution) in 1868.  The latter marks the end of Isabella's monarchy.  The brief rule of the liberal king Amadeo I of Spain ended in the establishment of the First Spanish Republic, only to be replaced in 1874 by the popular, moderate rule of Alfonso XII of Spain, which finally brought Spain into a period of stability and reform.\n\nDatia Palace, also known as Bir Singh Palace or Bir Singh Dev Palace is situated nearly 75 km from Gwalior City in Madhya pradesh.  The specialty of this palace is that it is of 7 floor.  However neither member from the royal family did ever lived here.

He said that the palace was nearly 80 meters long and was also this much broad.  He said this as a very beautiful and strong palace.\n\nMost of the Paris we see today is a result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide boulevards laid then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Parisian City evolution.  For this, Paris has many quarters that are not necessarily mentioned on any administrative Paris map, and many of these spread across several of the city's \"arrondissements\", so it would be useful to describe each independently of any administrative boundaries.\n\nŠuazeliai Palace is a building in Simonas Daukantas square, Vilnius Old Town, Lithuania.  Currently it is used as dwellings and \"Copy1\" company subsidiary.\n\nMangana (Greek: Μάγγανα ) was one of the quarters of Byzantine-era Constantinople.

The six-lane dual carriageway with grade separated junctions to an extended M1 Motorway was planned during the late 1960s along with the rest of the Ringway scheme.  It was never constructed due to large-scale opposition from many quarters.\n\nThe Old Town of Vilnius (Lithuanian: \"Vilniaus senamiestis\" , Polish: \"Stare Miasto w Wilnie\" , Belarusian: Стары горад Вільні , Russian: Старый город в Вильнe ), one of the largest surviving medieval old towns in Northern Europe, has an area of 3.59 square kilometres (887 acres).  It encompasses 74 quarters, with 70 streets and lanes numbering 1487 buildings with a total floor area of 1,497,000 square meters.  The oldest part of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, it has developed over the course of many centuries, and has been shaped by the city's history and a constantly changing cultural influence.
